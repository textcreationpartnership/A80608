            <title>The bloudy tenent, washed, and made white in the bloud of the Lambe: being discussed and discharged of bloud-guiltinesse by just defence. Wherein the great questions of this present time are handled, viz. how farre liberty of conscience ought to be given to those that truly feare God? And how farre restrained to turbulent and pestilent persons, that not onely raze the foundation of godlinesse, but disturb the civill peace where they live? Also how farre the magistrate may proceed in the duties of the first table? And that all magistrates ought to study the word and will of God, that they may frame their government according to it. Discussed. As they are alledged from divers Scriptures, out of the Old and New Testament.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160232:3"/>my judgement of it for the ſatisfaction of his friend. I wa not willing to deny him any office of Chriſtian love, and gave him my poore judgement in a private letter. This private letter of mine he hath publiſhed in Print after ſo many yeares, and there with a Reſuration of it. If my letter was Orthodoxall and tending to ſatisfaction, and edification, why did he refute it? If corrupt, and erronious (eſpecially if bloudy) why did he publiſh it?</p>
               <p>The letter, and ſo the error contained in it, (if it was an error) it was private, and ſo private, that I know no man that hath a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it, no not my ſelfe who penned it (for ought I could find) but himſelfe onely, if I did offend him by the writing of ſuch an error to him (though by himſelfe intreated to expreſſe my judgement) let him remember, he pleadeth for libertie of conſcience: I wrote my conſcience and the truth of God according to my conſcience, in the ſight of God. Why ſhould he puniſh me with open pennance, and expoſe me (as much as in him lieth, before the world) to open ſhame, as a man of bloud, for the liberty of my conſcience? How will it ſtand with his owne principles, to plead for liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and yet to puniſh it? Beſides let him remember, if I did offend him with ſuch an error, it was but a private offence, and the rule of the Goſpel required, he ſhould firſt have convinced and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me privately of it, and ſo have proceeded upon my contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, at length to have told the Church, before he had publiſhed it to the world. But ſuch as ſeeke for new Apoſtles, muſt ſeeke alſo for new Goſpel, before this manner of dealing can be juſtified, by the Goſpel of Chriſt. That booke of his therefore being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun againſt the rule of the Goſpel, no marvell if it ſwarve from the truth of the Goſpel all a long. He that ſetteth forth out of his way in the firſt entrance of his journey, no marvell if he wander all the day after.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus whileſt he pleadeth for Liberty of Conſcience, he taketh Liberty to his Conſcience openly to publiſh, That I do profeſſedly maintaine Perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience, When I doe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearmes profeſſedly Renounce it. This Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſetteth the Conſcience at Liberty <hi>Calumniandi audacter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be, by conſequence, I doe maintaine Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for cauſe of Conſcience, though in expreſſe tearmes I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly Renounce it.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What if ſuch a thing might be inferr'd by conſequence? mens judgements and profeſſions are not to be taken up from every unwary conſequence, againſt their owne poſitive and expreſſe Declarations, and Profeſſions. It is iuſtly taxed in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as a ſlanderous Calumny, that he bringeth in <hi>Luther, Calvine, Martyr Bucer,</hi> makeing God the Authour of ſinne, which all of them in expreſſe tearmes doe auoyde; yet he would faſten ſuch a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tenet upon them (forſooth) by conſequences. In like ſort by the like conſequences is the <hi>Bloudy Tenet</hi> faſtened upon me. When the eyes are bloud-ſhotten, or looke through a red glaſſe, all things about them will appeare red and bloudy. But if this Tenet have any appearance of blood in it, It is becauſe it is waſhed in the Bloud of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> and ſealed with his bloud. And then though it may ſeeme Bloudy to men of corrupt mindes deſtitute of the truth, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed to ſuch to be a Peſtilent fellow) yet to faithful and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſoules, ſuch things as are waſhed in the Bloud of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> are wont to come forth white, as did the followers of the <hi>Lambe, who waſhed their Robes white in the Bloud of the Lambe,</hi> Rev 7.14.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN ſtateing of the Queſtion I propounded ſome diſtinctions for clearing of the Point. The 1. was this in mine Anſwer to the Letter of the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience, I conceive you meane, either for profeſſing ſome point of Doctrine, which you beleive in Conſcience to be the Truth: or for practiſing ſome worke, which you beleive in Conſcience to be a Religious duty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Diſcuſſer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This diſtinction is not full and compleate. For beſides both theſe, a man may be perſecuted for cauſe of Conſcience, becauſe he dare not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yeild obedience to ſuch Doctrines and worſhips, as are by men Invented, and Appointed; As the three famous</hi> Jewes <hi>were caſt into the fiery Furnace (in a non-conformity to the whole conforming world) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the</hi> Golden Image, Dan. 3.21. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Thus a man may find a knot in a Bulruſh, yea thus a man that were diſpoſed might find fault with the Comforts of God for not being full and Compleate: with the Affirmative Comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not expreſſe the Negative; and with the Negative, becauſe they doe not expreſſe the Affirmative. He that maketh it perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience, when a man is puniſhed for profeſſing ſuch Doctrine, which he beleiveth in Conſcience to be the truth, he maketh it (a Pari) Perſecution for cauſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when a man is puniſhed for Renouncing ſuch Doctrines, which he beleiveth in Conſcience to be Erroneous. And he that maketh it Perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience, when a man is puniſhed for practiſing ſuch a worke, which he beleives in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be a Religious duty, He maketh it no leſſe Perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience, when a man is puniſhed for not practiſing ſuch a worke, which he beleiveth in Conſcience to be a ſin.</p>

               <p>Fundamentall Doctrines are of two ſorts: Some hold forth the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, as the Doctrines of ſalvation by Chriſt, and of faith in his Name, Repentance from dead workes, Reſurrection from the dead; and the like. Others concerne the Foundation of the Church, as the matter and forme of it, and the proper Adjuncts accompaning the ſame: The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of both theſe ſorts of Foundations together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake of the former ſort of theſe onely, namely the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or fundamentall points of Chriſtian Religion, which who ſo ſubverteth, and Renounceth, he renounceth alſo his owne ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The other ſort I looke at as leſſe principall, in compariſon of theſe, though ſome of them have a fundamentall vſe in Church order. It was pertinent to the Queſtion propounded in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners Letter, to expreſſe how farre I allowed Toleration even in ſuch fundamentall Errors, as ſubverted the Foundation of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160232:5"/>Chriſtian Religion. And in other Errors leſſe dangerous, ſuch as neither ſubverted Religion, nor Salvation, It would eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Toleration, might more eaſily be allowed.</p>
               <p>How farre <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Churches partake with the Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Pariſh Churches in any of the Ordinances of God, and upon what ground, hath been declared in the Reply to the Anſwer of the other Letter. Where alſo it hath been cleared, how farre off the Churches here have been from perſecuting, or oppreſſing any of their Brethren for preſenting light to them about this point: which may prevent and ſtill the lamentation of peace, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this fith Chapter.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It needs no inquiry what worſhip I meanes, whether Church, and Miniſter, or Miniſtrations of the Word, Prayer, Seales &amp;c. For I meane none of theſe, as they are diſpenced in the Churches of <hi>England.</hi> Though there have been corruptions in the order and diſpenſations of theſe things amongſt them, (eſpecially in the times when we lived there) yet neither their Churches, nor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, nor Miniſtrations were ſuch, or ſo falſe that fellowſhip with God could not be held of them, not onely inwardly and ſecretly, but alſo outwardly and viſibly: not onely in inward converſion and conviction, but alſo in outward and viſible Reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to light received. Take my words as I wrote them, and as he relateth them, and my meaning is plaine enough: I ſpeake of ſuch worſhip, which if falſe, fellowſhip with God is loſt: which cannot truly be avouched of any part of the Worſhip of God in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:160232:6"/>
               <p>It is not truly ſaid, that the Spirit of God maketh the Miniſtry one of the Foundations of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. for it is onely a foundation of Church Order, not of faith, or Religion, the Apoſtle puts an expreſſe difference between faith, and Church Order, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.5. Nor is it a true and ſafe ſpeech, to call the Fellowſhip or bleſſing of God vouchſafed to corrupt Churches, or Miniſters, or Miniſtrations <hi>to call it, I ſay, unpromiſed, or to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a word, or promiſe of God.</hi> For it is a large and yet an expreſſe promiſe of the Covenant of Grace, that God will be mercifull to our iniquities,
<note place="margin">Ier. 31.34.</note> That he will be mercifull to every one that prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart to ſeeke God, though he be not cleanſed according to the Purification of the Sanctuary, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20. with many more ſuch like. And therefore there wants not Promiſes of Grace and bleſſing to the People of God, notwithſtanding ſome defects and impurities found in their Adminiſtrations. Neither will it follow, <hi>that if our Miniſtery, and Ordination here be true, that then the former which we had in</hi> England <hi>was falſe, eſpecially ſo falſe, as that according to viſible Rule, Fellowſhip with God was loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Rite of Ordination we doe not looke at it as any Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Part of our vocation to the Miniſtry, no more then Coronation is an Eſſentiall Part of the Office of the King. And though we doe not juſtly ſundry things found in our Miniſtry, yet <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> the High Preiſt did not looſe his Fellowſhip with God, though he was cloathed with filthy Garments, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning Prayer, though the <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Miniſters have witneſſed againſt the Common ſet-Forme thereof, which yet our ſelves in our ignorance have ſomtimes uſed, and have therefore ſeen juſt cauſe to judge our ſelves ſince: yet we did not thereby looſe fellowſhip with God by ſuch ſinnnes of Ignorance, no more then the People of God did in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by ſacrifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in the High places, when yet they did it to the Lord their God onely, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.17.</p>
               <p>I know no ſuch faithfull Admoniſhers, as preſented to us in <hi>England, Arguments againſt the Common Prayer, which then ſeemed weake, but now are acknowledged to be ſound, though ſuch a thing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be true, howſoever forgotten. But this I am perſwaded to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe,</hi> that any of us ſatisfied our hearts with the <hi>Practiſe of the Author of the Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>who uſed to read ſome of the choyſeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:160232:6"/>ſelect Prayers out of the</hi> Maſſ-Booke. The Spirit of a childe of God, though upon occaſion he may receive ſuch a Practiſe, yet he can never ſatisfie himſelfe with the Practiſe of any godly man for the warrant of his Imitation without ſome further light (or at leaſt apprehenſion of light) from the word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is readily graunted, (that which is obſerved in the third place) That Gods people may live and die in ſuch kindes of Worſhip, though light from the Word, whether publickly or privately hath been preſented to them able to convince,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, that will not weaken the Concluſion (formerly mentioned, and afterwards further diſcuſſed) <hi>That Fundamentalls are ſo cleare, that a man cannot but be convinced in Conſcience of the Truth of them after two or three Admonitions: and that therefore ſuch a Perſon as ſtill continueth obſtinate, is condemned of himſelfe: and if he then be puniſhed, He is not puniſhed for his Conſcience, but for ſinning againſt his owne Conſcience.</hi> For both theſe may well ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are farre of from croſſing or contrarying one another. A ſet forme of Prayer, though it be unlawfull, yet it is not ſuch a Fundamentall Error either in judgement or practiſe, as cutteth off from fellowſhip with God: That is onely a reſolute Aſſertion of the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> but a vouched without all colour or pretence from the Scripture. There is ſome reſemblance and proportion betweene Praying and Propheſying; <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed an unwarranted way and Forme of Propheſying, when God Commaunding him to ſpeake to the Rock before the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> He ſpake not to the Rock, but ſtroke it with his Rod, (for which he had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement) and ſpake to the People and that in a Paſſion (and (and both without a Commaundament) <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.8.11. And yet this did not cutt off his Fellowſhip with God, nor Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſence with him in giving water to the People, no not at that time, God knoweth how to be preſent with his People, in bleſſing their Adminiſtrations, and forgiving their iniquities, though he doe take vengeance of their Inventions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though I doe maintaine (as the Apoſtle doth) a Clearneſſe of Fundamentall Points of Religion and Worſhip (ſuch Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls I ſay, without which, Fellowſhip with God cannot be had) and though I graunt, that in ſubſerting ſuch Fundamentall Points, and perſiſting therein after once or twice Admonition, a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:160232:7"/>man ſinneth againſt his owne Conſcience, and is therefore cenſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able by the Church, yea and by the Civill Magiſtrate alſo, if after Conviction he continue to ſeduce others unto his Damnable Hereſie; <hi>yet I doe not herein meaſure to others, that which my ſelf, when I lived in ſuch practiſes, would not have meaſured to my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I thank God, God never left me to live in any ſuch Practiſes, as to fall into any Fundamentall Error, much leſſe to Perſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after Conviction and Admonition, and leaſt of all to ſeduce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thereinto. If God ſhould leave me ſo farre, as to fall ſo feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into this three-fold degree of Hereticall wickedneſſe, what am I better then other men? better my ſelfe cut off by death, or Baniſhment, then the Flock of Chriſt to be ſeduced and deſtroyed by my Hereticall wickedneſſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, for Civill peace, what is it, ſaith he, but Pax Civitatis, whether</hi> Engliſh, <hi>or</hi> Iriſh, Spaniſh <hi>or</hi> Turkiſh <hi>City.</hi>

               <p>Be it ſo, and if the Civill State, or Common-wealth containe many Citties, or Townes, and ſo become a whole Countrey or Common-wealth, let Civill Peace be the peace of the Countrey, or of the Common-wealth. But what is then the peace of the Citty, or Countrey? Is it not <hi>Tranquillitas Ordinis</hi> the tranquility of order in every Society, wherein the Publicke Weale of the Citty, or Countrey is concerned? And is it not the proper worke of the Civill Magiſtrate to preſerve the Civill Peace, and to prevent or reforme the diſturbance of the Tranquility or Peace of any ſuch Societyes, in whoſe Peace, the Peace or Weale of the Citty or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is concerned? Suppoſe a Society of Merchants or Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:160232:7"/>or Fiſhmongers, or Drapers, or the like: If the Weale of the Citty or Countrey be concerned in theſe, (as it is much concerned in them all): It is not for the ſafety of the Civill Sate to ſuffer any of theſe ſo to be diſturbed, as wholely to breake up, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No matter</hi> (<hi>ſaith the</hi> Diſcuſſer) <hi>though they doe wholly breake up into peices and diſſolve into nothing. For nevertheleſſe the Peace of the Citty is not thereby in the leaſt meaſure impaired or diſturbed: becauſe the Eſſence or being of the Citty is Eſſentially diſtinct from thoſe particular Societyes &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>If by Peace be meant (as in Scripture Language it is) all welfare, It would argue a man that liveth in the world, to be too much Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſtate of the world, <hi>to ſay that in the breaking up and diſſolving of ſuch perticular Societyes, the Peace of the Citty or Countrey is not in the leaſt meaſure impaired, or diſturbed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. Though ſuch Societyes of Merchants and other Trades, be not of the Eſſence of the Citty; yet they be of the integrety of the Citty. And if the defect of one Tribe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a great trouble to all the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (<hi>Judges,</hi> 21.2, 3.) then ſure the breaking up and diſſolving of ſo many particular uſefull Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etyes cannot but much impaire and diſturbe the Peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Citty and Countrie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though theſe Societyes of Trades be not of the Eſſence of the Citty, yet they are amongſt the conſervant cauſes of the Citty: as without which the Citty cannot long flouriſh, no nor well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Common ſenſe will acknowledge ſo much.</p>
               <p>Now then if all theſe particular Societyes and ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes of Trades, they and their peace and wellfare doe much concerne the wellfare and peace of the Citty and Countrey, and therefore it behooveth the Civill Government to provide for their peace and wellfare: I demand, whether the Church alſo, (which is a particular Society of Chriſtians) whether, I ſay, the Peace and wellfare of it, doe not concerne the Peace and wellfare of the Citty or Countrey where they live?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be denyed it is Eaſily proved:</hi>

And what is the Church, but a Congregation of Righteous men? If the Rejoycing of the Church be the glory of a Nation, ſurely the diſturbing, and diſtracting, and diſſolving of the Church, is the ſhame and Confuſion of a Nation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Excellency and Preheminence of the Church above all other Societyes. <hi>She is the faireſt amongſt women,</hi> Cant. 1.8. and 6.1. <hi>She is the Citty and Houſe of God,</hi> Revel. 21.2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a matter of juſt diſpleaſure to God, and ſad greife of heart to the Church, when Civill States looke at the eſtate of the Church, as of little, or no concernment to themſelves. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object</hi> 1. <hi>Many glorious and flouriſhing Cittyes of the world main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their Civill Peace: yea the very</hi> Americans, <hi>and wildeſt</hi> Pagans, <hi>keep the Peace of their Townes, and Cittyes, though neither in the one, nor in the other can any man prove a true Church of God in theſe places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, where the Church is not, Cittyes and Townes may enjoy ſome meaſure of Civill Peace, yea and flouriſh in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity for a time, through the Patience and Bounty and Long-ſufferance of God. <hi>The times of Jgnorance God winketh at Act.</hi> 17.30. But when the Church cometh to be Planted amongſt them, If then Civill States doe neglect them, &amp; ſuffer the Churches to corrupt, and annoy themſelves by pollutions in Religion, the the ſtaffe of the Peace of the Common-wealth will ſoone be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as the Purity of Religion is broken in the Churches. The Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed five hundred yeares before the Kingdome of God in his Church came amongſt them: and the decayes of the Common-wealth occaſioned by the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, were Repaired by the Publick eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:160232:8"/>the Churches peace in Chriſtian Emperors. But when the Churches begun to pollute themſelves by the Idolatrous worſhip of Images, and the Chriſtian Emperors tooke no care to reforme this abuſe in Churches, the Lord ſent in (amongſt other barberous nations) the <hi>Turkes</hi> to puniſh, not onely degenerate Churches, but alſo the Civill State for this wickedneſſe. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt upbraideth them for their continuance in Image worſhip, though the <hi>Turke</hi> were let looſe from the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to ſcourge them for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.14.20. Goe now, and ſay, the eſtate of the Church whether true, or falſe, (pure or corrupt) doth not concerne the Civill Peace of the Sate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. <hi>The Peace of the Church (whether true or falſe) is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſo of an higher and farre different nature from the peace of the Countrey, or People, which is meerely and Eſſentially Civill and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though the inward peace of the Church be ſpirituall and heavenly: yet there is an outward peace of the Church due to them (even from Princes and Magiſtrates) in a way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honeſty, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.2. But in a way of ungodlineſſe, and Idolatry, it is an wholeſome faithfulneſſe to the Church if Princes trouble the outward peace of the Church, that ſo the Church finding themſelves wounded and pricked in the houſe of their friends, they may repent, and returne to their firſt Husband, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2.6.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Though the peace of the Countrey or Common-wealth be Civill and humane, yet it is diſtracted and cutt off, by diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirituall purity, and peace of the Church. <hi>Jehu</hi> cutting ſhort his Reformation, God cutt ſhort the coaſts of the Civill State. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.31.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. Civill Peace (to ſpeake properly) is not onely a peace in civill things, for the Object; but a peace of all the perſons of the Citty, for the Subject. The Church is one Society in the Citty, as well as is the Society, of Merchants, or Drapers, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and Haberdaſhers, and if it be a part of Civill Juſtice, out of regard to Civill Peace, to protect all other Societyes in peace according to the wholeſome Ordinances of their Company, is it not ſo, much more to protect the Church-Society in peace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wholeſome Ordinances of the Word of Chriſt?</p>

               <p>HERE 2. Things he complaineth of, 1. That I have not <hi>declared what this Arrogant and impetuous way is:</hi> 2. <hi>That he cannot but expreſſe his ſad and ſorrowfull obſervation, how it pleaſeth God to leave me, to take up the Common Reproachfull Accuſation of the Accuſer of Gods Children, That they are arrogant and impetuous.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I did not thinke it needfull to declare what an Arrogant and Impetuous way was, ſeeing his Requeſt was, not that I ſhould compile a diſcourſe of mine owne: but that I ſhould returne an Anſwer to the Letter of his friend. And it is an Anſwerers part not to Expatiate into declarations, but diſtinctly and cloſely to remove Objections. Beſides himſelfe is not ignorant of this point, nor needeth to be taught, what an Arrogant, and impetuous way is. For he himſelfe telleth us (in his 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter) <hi>That the Civill Peace may be broken by holding forth a Doctrine or practiſe, with ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or reviling, daring or challenging ſpeeches (which is a way of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy:) or with force of Armes, Swords, Gunns &amp;c.; which is a way of Impetuouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be deſired that I ſhould declare my ſelf herein, thus brei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it. He holdeth forth an erronious Doctrine, or Practiſe, in an Arrogant and Impetuous way, not onely who carrieth it in a reviling and daring way (which is a diſturbance to Civill Peace:) But alſo he who refuſeth to ſubject his ſpirit to the ſpirit of the Prophets in a holy Church of Chriſt (contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32.) which is a diſturbance to the peace of the Church. And withall, he that ſhall oppoſe ſuch as diſſent from his Errors, either by violent meanes (as the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> did by Clubbs, and Swords, and as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:160232:9"/>
                  <hi>Zedekiah</hi> did <hi>Micajah</hi> with Fiſts, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 22.24.) or by cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reproaches, and by rejecting Communion with them even before conviction, or admonition, all theſe are wayes of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and Imperuouſneſſe, and tend to the diſturbance either of civill, or of Church Peace, or of both.</p>
               <p>But for the 2. His ſad and ſorrowfull Obſervation, that God hath left me to take up the common reproachful Accuſation of the Children of God, as if they were Arrogant, and Impetuous in their way, upon what ground the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> taketh this up, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I cannot Imagine, unleſſe,
<q>Conſcius ipſe ſibi, de ſe put at omnia dici.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is not the leaſt jot or tittle in my Letter, that applyeth this Accuſation of Arrogance, or impetuouſneſſe to any of the Children of God at all. Nor had I the leaſt thought of himſelfe, when I wrote that Letter, who (for ought I can remember) did then keepe communion with all his Brethren, and held loving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>As for theſe ſix Caſes he ſpeaketh of (or rather, wayes) wherein the Children of God have oppoſed the ſtreame of the times, and have there upon been taxed as Arrogant and impetuous Troublers of the State, &amp; yet were none ſuch, I willingly allow them to ſtand good, ſave onely they might as well be reduced to 2. or 3. Heads, as branched out into 6. But howſoever, they are nothing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Point in hand: none of them being wayes of Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor Impetuouſneſſe, but of well Ordered, and Chriſtian faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and Magnanimity. If any of them did put forth acts of Impetuous violence, (as <hi>Elijah</hi> did in putting the Prophets of <hi>Baall</hi> to death 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.40.) It was done by vertue of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling, or elſe by the conſent of the King and people then preſent.</p>
               <p>Beſides as none of the fix wayes wherein the Meſſengers of God walked againſt the ſtreame of the times, were wayes of Arrogance, and impetuouſneſſe, ſo much leſſe were theſe holy men of God Impetuous, in holding forth any Error, or evill practiſe, which is the Point in hand.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is as little to the purpoſe, as that which went before. The diſtinction ſpake of holding forth Erroneous and unlawful things, in a way tending of it ſelfe, to the diſturbance of Civill Peace. This Diſcuſſion holdeth forth another way tending to the diſturbance of Civill Peace, not of it ſelfe, but by occaſion or by Accident, to wit, when the holding forth of Light and Truth diſturbeth the ſore Eyes of a corrupt State. If <hi>per ſe,</hi> and <hi>per Accidens</hi> (of it ſelfe, and by occaſion) be all one: If the holding forth of Truth, and Error be all one, then this Diſcuſſion hath ſhaken the diſtinction of holding forth Error, not in an humble and meeke way, but in a way of Arrogance and Impetuouſneſſe. But when he ſaith, <hi>vigilant and faithfull Perſons are not ſo troubled, no not at the falſe Religion of Jew or Gentile:</hi> If he meane not ſo much troubled at the falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as corrupt Sates be at the true Religion: there may be truth in the ſpeech, but it onely argueth, That corrupt nature is more zealous in the defence of its owne will-worſhip, then the faithfull be in the defence of the Truth. But ſurely the faithful are called to contend Earneſtly for the Faith, (<hi>Jude</hi> 3.) and have as much cauſe to be troubled at the holding forth of the Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> as corrupt States be at the holding forth of the Worſhip of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi> If his meaning be, that vigilant and faithfull Perſons, are not ſo troubled at the falſe Religion of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> but that they can Tolerate them to live amongſt them in a Civill Body, we ſay ſo too: And therefore the <hi>Indians,</hi> who have ſubmitted to the Government of this juriſdiction, are not compelled to the Profeſſion or acknowledgement of our Religion, either by Force of Armes, or Poenall Lawes. But yet if Chriſtians ſhould ſeduce Chriſtians to turne Apoſtates from the Faith, and to imbrace <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> or <hi>Paganiſme:</hi> Or if <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> living amongſt us ſhould openly blaſpheme the God of heaven, &amp; draw away Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> or <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> I ſhould not account them either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, or faithfull Chriſtians, that were not troubled at ſuch a deſtroying of the true Religion, and propagating of the falſe. <hi>Paul</hi> blamed the falſe Teachers to be the Troublers of the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Gal.</hi> 5.10, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24.</p>

               <p>Then it ſeemeth, that if the <hi>Mariners</hi> of the <hi>Ship</hi> wherein <hi>Jonah</hi> ſayled when he fled from the Preſence of God, if they I ſay did caſt <hi>Jonah</hi> over board into the Sea, this prepoſterous way of theirs in ſuppreſſing the Error of his way, was it which raiſed the ſtorme and Tempeſt, whereby the <hi>Ship</hi> was toſſed to and fro, &amp; diſturbed, yea &amp; in jeopardy to be ſunk and deſtroyed. But the Text ſpeakes to the contrary, when they had caſt <hi>Jonah</hi> forth into the Sea, the Sea ceaſed from his raging, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>But what was the ſinne of <hi>Jonah?</hi> was it not ſome ſinne againſt the ſecond Table, ſome act of unrighteouſneſſe againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? It was a direct and immediate breach of a rule of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Office, a ſin againſt the ſecond Commandement of the Firſt Table. But was not the Sea, in which this tempeſt aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jonah,</hi> and againſt the whole <hi>Ship</hi> for his ſake, was it not the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> which being within the Confines of the Holy Land, the Sea alſo was Holy, and would not ſuffer ſuch a ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed? No, the Sea of <hi>Tiberias</hi> is within the Confines of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and other parts of the Land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> But this was the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> Sea, between <hi>Joppa</hi> and <hi>Tarſhiſh, Jonah</hi> 1.3. But were not theſe <hi>Mariners, Iſraelites,</hi> who might have ſome ſpeciall charge from God, to roote out all Idolatry and falſe Worſhip from amongſt them, which bindeth not us <hi>Gentiles?</hi> No, they were <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as appeareth in that every one of them cryed out, unto his own God.</p>
               <p>But why did not God ſend out the tempeſt to puniſh thoſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:160232:12"/>Mariners</hi> rather, for their Idolatry then <hi>Jonah</hi> for his Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Practiſe in running away from the true God?</p>
               <p>God in times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walke in their owne wayes <hi>Acts,</hi> 14.16. And ſo did his Vicegerents the good Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doe the like: <hi>David</hi> did not compell the tributary Nations to worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> No more doth our Colony here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the tributary <hi>Indians</hi> to worſhip our God. But if an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> forſake God, he diſturbeth not onely the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the Barks of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> ſtates as <hi>Jonah</hi> did this <hi>Ship,</hi> by his departure from God. Therefore a Chriſtian by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, may diſturbe a <hi>Gentile</hi> civill State. And it is no prepoſterous way for the Governours of the State, according to the quality of the diſturbance raiſed by the ſtarting aſide of ſuch a Chriſtian, to puniſh both it and him by civill cenſure.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the Civill State in ſuch puniſhments attend ſo much, how to procure the converſion of Heretickes, or Apoſtates, or ſuch like ſcandalous turbulent offenders: as how to prevent the perverſion of their ſounder people <hi>(Gangraenam amoveas, ne pars ſincera trabatur:)</hi> or elſe to worke the ſubverſion of ſuch, as doe ſubvert both truth and peace.</p>
               <p>And yet as legall terrours are ordinary meanes bleſſed of God to prepare hard and ſtout hearts to converſion: ſo ſuch legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God is in like ſort pleaſed to bleſſe to the confuſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of falſe Prophets, as was foretold by <hi>Zacharie,</hi> it ſhould come to paſſe in the dayes of the new Teſtament, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6.</p>

And the judgements of men executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word, are ſanctified of God to prevent the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Idolatry and ſeducement to it; All <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall heare and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11. Nor is the righteous proceeding in Civill States a diſquieting of themſelves, <hi>or any unmercifull diſquieting of others.</hi> For it is no diſquieting to a juſt man to doe Juſtice: and the diſquieting of men in ſinne, it is no unmercifull dealing, but a compaſſionate healing either of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others. The falſe Prophet reclaimed by ſtigmatizing with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:160232:12"/>wounds in his hands, will freely acknowledge, thus was I woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Houſe of my friends (<hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6.) Friends are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull diſquieters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Judgements of God which goe forth as the light are not of the Judgements of his hand, but of his mouth, for ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth himſelfe in that place of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> I have hewen them by the Prophets, I have ſlaine them by the words of my mouth: And thy Judgements were as the light that goeth forth.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Judgements of God, whether of his mouth or of his hand, doe both of them goe forth as light.

               <p>It may ſeeme though the Truth be as cleare as the Beames of the Sunne, yet the Diſcuſſer can eſpie a moate of admirable weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the delivering of ſuch a Poſition, though never ſo true or cleare. But let him ceaſe his Admiration, unleſſe it be to admire his owne Fancy.</p>
               <p>For I doe not lay it downe as a Poſition, that it is not lawfull to perſecute the Lord Jeſus: or that Chriſt in his Truth muſt not be perſecuted. But my Poſition was, It is not lawfull to perſecute any for Conſcience ſake, rightly informed: And for a reaſon hereof, I give this Principle, for in perſecuting ſuch, Chriſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted: Is it now become an admirable ſtrange thing to give a Principle of Religion, not for a Poſition, (and yet if it were ſo, what ſtrange thing were it?) but for the proofe of a Poſition? Let me give you a like inſtance, <hi>Gamaliel</hi> layeth it downe for a Poſition, that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, if it be of God, the Prieſts and Elders cannot overthrow it: and he gives this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a reaſon of it, <hi>leſt in ſo doing, ye be found</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to fight againſt God, Acts</hi> 5.38, 39. Now is this ſuch a matter as will be admired of all ſober men, that ſo wiſe a man as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſhould lay downe this as a Poſition, That men ſhould not be found figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt God? May not a man rather admire and adore the ſtrange hand of God, that ſhall leave a man ſoberly to admire at ſuch a thing, and to thinke all ſober men will in like ſort wonder at the ſame? But the truth is, Neither <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> nor my ſelfe, laid downe that Principle for a Concluſion, nor for a Poſition: nor if we had, had we done any thing for ſober men to admire at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though it were true, (which the Diſcuſſer makes the Ground of his Admiration,) That no <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> did ever profeſſe to perſecute the Sonne of God, Chriſt as Chriſt, &amp;c.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:160232:14"/>yet it will not make it an admirable Point, that Chriſt as Chriſt is not to be perſecuted. For though they doe not profeſſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Chriſt as Chriſt: yet they doe it. And it is no admirable matter for all ſober men to admire at, to tell men that perfecute the Lord Jeſus, That it is not lawfull for them ſo to doe: Did not Chriſt himſelfe (the wiſedome of the Father) tell <hi>Saul</hi> as much? <hi>Acts</hi> 9.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as cleare, (to uſe his phraſe) as the Sunne beames, both in Scripture and other hiſtories, and frequent experience, That Tyrants and Apoſtates have often perſecuted Jeſus as Jeſus, Chriſt as Chriſt. The Scribes and Phariſees they knew that Chriſt was the Sonne of God, the Lord, and Heire of the Church: And therefore they ſaid among themſelves, <hi>This is the Heire, come let us kill him, Matth.</hi> 21.38. Nor could they be ſaid, in perſecuting Chriſt, to have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt: if they had not beene enlightened to know him who he was, and yet leavened with ſuch malice, as to perſecute him, as they did. Hiſtories tell us, that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate perſecuted Jeſus as Jeſus, and Chriſt as Chriſt, yea and profeſſed ſo to doe. And experience telleth, That if a Chriſtian ſhall in <hi>Turkey</hi> ſeeke to gaine <hi>Turkes</hi> from the ſervice of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to the Faith of Jeſus: they will perſecute ſuch a Chriſtian to death, and in him Jeſus, as Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let Tyrants and Perſecutours profeſſe what they will, that they doe not perſecute Jeſus as Jeſus, but under ſome other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: yet that varieth not the Truth, nor impeacheth the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this Poſition, That it is not lawfull to perſecute any for Conſcience rightly informed, or to perſecute any for profeſſing the Truth of Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One thing I ſee apparently in the Lords overruling of the pen of this Anſwerer, viz. a ſecret whiſpering from Heaven to him, That yet he hath never left the Tents of ſuch who thinke they doe God good ſervice in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lord Jeſus in his ſervants, and yet ſay if we had been in the dayes of our Fathers in Queen</hi> Maryes <hi>dayes, we would never have conſented to ſuch Perſecution &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Verily this is a ſtrange ſight indeed, (and which all ſober minds
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:160232:14"/>may well wonder at) <hi>to ſee apparently, That he who layeth downe this for a Poſition, That it is not lawfull to perſecute any for Conſcience right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed, hath had a ſecret whiſpering from Heaven, that himſelfe never yet left the Tents of Perſecutors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely it muſt needs be a ſtrange and ſtrong ſight, even the fight of ſuch as make themſelves equall with God; that can ſee a man hath not left the Tents of Perſecutors, (that is, the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Perſecutors) when he openly profeſſeth it, to be utterly unlawfull to Perſecute any for the Truths ſake. It is true, God may ſee that in a mans heart which is contrary to the Profeſſion of his mouth and Pen. And ſo may this <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſee as much, if he be equall with God. But yet herein I dare be bold to ſay, he exalteth himſelfe, not onely equall with God, but above God, to ſee one contradictory in another, which God himſelfe cannot ſee. It is contradictory to Perſecution, to beleive it unlawfull to perſecute any for the Truths ſake. He then that can ſee, yea &amp; ſee apparently, &amp; that out of the Faith &amp; Profeſſion of this truth, that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to perſecute any for the Truth, he that can ſee (I ſay) fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with perſecution in the faith, or Profeſſion of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Perſecution, verily he can ſee darkneſſe in light, evill in good, Falſhood in Truth, which God himſelfe (Such is the perfection of his Truth) cannot doe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Let me alſo add a ſecond, So farre as the Anſwerer (by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Perſecution) hath been a guide to others in perſecuting any of the Servants of Chriſt witneſſing to his Truth, ſo farre his own mouth and hands ſhall judge (I hope not his perſon, but) his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Lord Jeſus hath ſuffered by him.</p>

                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>If any Doctrine Preached by me have Guided any to perſecute any of the Servants of Chriſt for witneſſing to any Truth of Chriſt, then I confeſſe I muſt lay my hand upon my mouth, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Lord Jeſus hath ſuffered by me. But if the <hi>Diſouſſer</hi> can never be able to produce any ſuch Doctrine broached by me that hath guided any to perſecute any of Gods Servants for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to any Truth of his, (as I truſt in the grace of Chriſt, he ſhall never be able) then the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> may know (and the Lord
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:160232:15"/>help his ſpirit to know it) that his own mouth and hands, ſhal one day judge (if not his perſon, yet) his actions, that the Lord Jeſus hath ſuffered in his poore Servants, even bitter perſecutions by his unjuſt ſlanders.</p>

               <p>The ſecond Concluſion lay'd downe by the Anſwerer, is: <hi>It is not lawfull to perſecute an Erroneous and blinde Conſcience, Even in Fundamentall, and weighty Points, till after Admonition once, or twice</hi> Tit. 3.10, 11. <hi>And then ſuch Conſciences may be perſecuted; becauſe the Word of God is ſo cleare, in Fundamentall and weighty Points, that ſuch a perſon cannot but ſinne againſt his Conſcience, and ſo being condemned of himſelfe, that is of his Conſcience, he may be perſecuted for ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Conſcience.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>They are the words of the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> not mine, That ſuch as erre in Fundamentall and weighty Points, after once or twice Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, ſuch Conſciences are then to be perſecuted.</p>
               <p>No, my words will cleare themſelves if they be truly related, even as himſelfe hath printed them. Thus they ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, For an erroneous and blinde Conſcience, even in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and weighty Points, It is not lawfull to perſecute any, till after Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition once or twice. And ſo the Apoſtle directeth</hi> Tit. 3.10. <hi>and giveth the reaſon, That in Fundamentall &amp; principall Points of Doctrine and worſhip, The Word of God in ſuch things is ſo cleare, that he cannot but be convinced in conſcience of the dangerous Error of his way, after once or twice Admonition, wiſely and faithfully diſpenced. And then if any one perſiſt, It is not out of Conſcience, but againſt his Conſcience, as the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> ver. 11. He is ſubverted and ſinneth being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of himſelfe, <hi>that is, of his owne Conſcience, ſo that if ſuch a man after ſuch Admonition, ſhall ſtill perſiſt in the Error of his way, and be

               <p>Where though I ſay, That it is not lawfull to perſecute any, though erring in Fundamental and weighty Points, till after once or twice admonition: I doe not therefore ſay, (as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> reporteth me) that after once or twice admonition, then ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may be perſecuted: <hi>But that if ſuch a man after ſuch Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition ſhall ſtill perſiſt in the Error of his way, and be therefore puniſhed, He is not perſecuted for cauſe of Conſcience, but for ſinning againſt his own Conſcience.</hi>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But he that ſayeth, It is not lawfull to perſecute any Heretick till after once or twice admonition, He doth as much as ſay, that after once or twice admonition, It is then lawfull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute any Heretick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo neither, neither every Heretick, nor in every Court. Not in every Court or Judicature. But the ſame Church that followed an Heretick, with once or twice admonition, was further to purſue him, if he remaine obſtinate, with excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; my words doe expreſſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That an Heretick till after once or twice admonition, may not be purſued, no not with the Church-cenſure of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but after once or twice admonition, It was then lawfull for the Church to proceed to his Excommunication.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>But it was no part of my words or meaning, to ſay, that every Heretick, though erring in ſome Fundamentall and weighty Points; and for the ſame excommunicated, ſhall forth with be puniſhed by the Civill Magiſtrate: unleſſe it doe afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he breake forth further, either into Blaſphemy, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, or ſeducement of others to his Hereticall pernicious wayes.</p>

                  <hi>What is this Heretick? I find him commonly defined to be, ſuch an one as is obſtinate in Fundamentalls. And ſo the Anſwerer ſeemeth to Reſent him, ſaying, the Apoſtle rendereth this reaſon, why after once or twice Admonition, he ought to be Perſecuted, becauſe, in Fundament ill and Principall Points of Doctrine and Worſhip, the Word of God is ſo cleare, that the Heretick cannot but be convinced in his owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But of this Reaſon I find not one Tittle mentioned in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for ſo he ſaith, ſuch an one is condemned of himſelfe, yet he ſaith not, nor will it follow, that Fundamentalls are ſo cleare, that after firſt and ſecond Admonition, a Perſon that ſubmitteth not to them, Is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of himſelfe, more then in leſſer Points.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word then an Heretick is no more, then an obſtinate and willfull perſon in the Church of <hi>Creet</hi> ſtriving and contending about unprofitable Queſtions &amp; Genealogies. What is to be done with ſuch an one? Let him be once and twice Admoniſhed. What if once and twice Admonition prevaile not? The Apoſtle ſeemeth to Anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> is ſo farre from weakening what I ſaid from this Text in <hi>Titus,</hi> that he rather confirmeth it, yea and graunteth a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:160232:16"/>larger allowance to proceed againſt erroneous Perſons, then I did. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas I had ſaid, The Apoſtle directeth the Church to proceed againſt an Heretick, that is againſt one obſtinately erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in Fundamentalls, The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſaith, <hi>yea and againſt ſuch as erre though not in Fundamentalls, but in leſſer points, and continue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in ſtriving about unprofitable Queſtions, and Genealogies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He that graunteth (as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> doth) that the Word of God is ſo cleare even in leſſer Points, that he that perſiſteth in his error after once or twice Admonition, is willfully obſtinate: he ſurely will not ſticke to acknowledge, that the word of God is much more cleare in Fundamentall and Principall Points, that he that ſhall perſiſt in Errors againſt the Foundation, after once or twice Admonition, he cannot but be much more juſtly accounted willfully obſtinate, and to ſinne againſt the light of his owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though he ſaith he findeth no one Tittle in the Text, that in Fundamentall and Principall Points of Doctrine and Worſhip, the Word of God is ſo cleare, that after once or twice Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Heretick cannot but be convinced in his owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Yet he might eaſily find it, and cannot but find it, if he were pleaſed to ponder the words of the Text: yea and he doth find it, though he be pleaſed to deny it. For the Heretick (whom the Text ſpeaketh of) himſelfe expoundeth to be a man willfully obſtinate: An Evidence, that he erreth not through want of light, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of knowledge, but through ſtrength of will. Whence alſo he is ſaid to be condemned of himſelfe, of his owne Conſcience: An Evidence that the Points about which he erreth, are ſo clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scripture, that after once or twice Admonition, the Heretick cannot but be convinced in his owne Conſcience. And if this hold in ſundry leſſer Points, how much more doth it hold in Fundamentalls and Principalls? Unleſſe he thinke the Holy Ghoſt be more darke, &amp; obſcure in delivering Principles and milke to Babes, then in delivering leſſer Points to men of riper growth. If the word be ſo cleare as to make Fundamentals clear, (though not any more cleare, as he ſaith, then leſſer Points) yet then it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, It maketh them both ſo cleare, that he that ſubmiteth not to them after once, or twice Admonition is condemned of himſelfe.</p>

               <p>Onely 2. Things more remaine in this Chapter which may not paſſe without ſome touch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he ſaith Gods People in all their awakenings acknowledge how ſleightly they have liſtned to the checks of their owne Conſcience. This the Anſwerer pleaſeth to call ſinning againſt Conſcience: for which he may lawfully be perſecuted, to wit, for ſinning againſt his owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein there is found a double falſhood: 1. <hi>That he ſaith, I call the ſleight liſtnings of Gods People to the checks of their Conſcience, their ſinning againſt Conſcience.</hi> For I ſpeake not of the ſinning of Gods People againſt Conſcience, but of an Heretick ſubverted tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off from the Foundation: much leſſe doe I call their ſleight liſtnings to Conſcience, to be Hereticall ſinning againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Leaſt of all doe I ſay, that for ſuch ſleight liſtnings to the checks of Conſcience, he may lawfully be perſecuted, to wit, as for ſinning againſt Conſcience. Thus men that have time and leaſure at will, will ſet up Images of clouts, and then ſhoot at them.</p>
               <p>The 2. Thing in this Chapter (which I ſaid might not paſſe without ſome touch) is, that having faſtned upon me a concluſion, (which is none of mine, but an invention of his owne) <hi>He addeth, howſoever it be painted over with vermillion &amp;c. yet he hopeth to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it to be the overturning and rooting up of the roote of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and abſolutely denying the Lord Jeſus to be come in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto I Reply no more but this: If he doe manifeſt that which Magnanimouſly he undertaketh, It may happyly be alſo manifeſted (by the helpe of Chriſt) that it will overturne no concluſion of mine. But howſoever, let him remember it was a proverb in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Let not him that girdeth on his Armour, boaſt himſelfe, as he that putteth it off 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.11.</p>

                  <hi>THe firſt and ſecond Admonitions in the place of</hi> Titus <hi>were not Civill or corporall puniſhments on mens perſons, or purſes: But they were the reprehenſions, convictions, exhortations, and perſwaſions of the word of the Eternall God, charged home to the Conſcience, in the Name and Preſence of the Lord Jeſus in the midſt of his Church. Which being deſpiſed, and not hearkened unto, in the laſt place followeth rejection, which is not a cutting off by heading, hanging, burning, nor an expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the Countrey, and coaſts: but the dreadfull cutting off from the viſible head and body, Chriſt Jeſus, and his Church—Spirituall cutting off by Excommunication.</hi>

               <p>All this, &amp; the proofes of this, in this Chapter, I willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſubſcribe unto: nor doth this touch any concluſion of mine at all, much leſſe Diſcuſſe, or ſhake it. For though I ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that for an erroneous and blinde Conſcience <hi>(even in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and weighty Points) It is not lawfull to perſecute any, till after Admonition once or twice, according to</hi> Tit. 3.10.11.</p>
               <p>Yet in alledging that place, to prove that Concluſion, I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no other perſecution, but the Churches proſecution againſt ſuch an Heretick by excommunication: no ſyllable in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion looketh at more.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, but Excommunication or any other Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, cannot fitly be called perſecution: Yes verily, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is a perſecution, and a lawfull perſecution, if the cauſe be juſt offence, (as the Angell of the Lord is ſaid to perſecute the wicked <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 35.6.) But the Excommunication is a cruell and bitter perſecution, If it be without juſt cauſe and due order: yea and the more greivous perſecution, by how much the more grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous it is to a Chriſtian man, to be excluded from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints, then to be baniſhed from a civill Society, ſure it is, the Lord Jeſus accounteth it a perſecution to his Diſciples, to be delivered up unto the Synagogues, and to be caſt forth out of the Synagogues <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.12. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2.</p>

Now evident it is, that Goats were cleane Beaſts, as well as Sheep; cleane for food, yea and cleane alſo for ſacrifice; and yet they were tolerated not onely to live in the ſame world, but in the ſame Church. For after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, when pureſt times of the Church ſhall come, the Members of the Church ſhall all of them be Virgins, (none Idolaters) though ſome wiſe, and ſome fooliſh; all of them ſervants, though ſome thriſtie, ſome unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: all of them cleane, though ſome Goats, ſome Sheep. And therefore the Kingdome of Heaven (that is, the Church) is at that time reſembled to ſuch a mixt ſtate (after the ruine of Antichriſt, and converſion of the Jewes) untill the coming of Chriſt to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1. &amp;c.</p>

If the Field ſhould be the world, and the Tares Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians and falſe Chriſtians; it is true, Satan ſowed them in Gods Field, but he ſowed them in the Church. The myſtery of their Iniquitie did ſecretly work in the very boſome of the Church, till in proceſſe of time, it grew ſo ranck and groſſe, as transformed the Churches that drunke it up, into ſpirituall Babylon. But if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt be an Apoſtate, and Antichriſtianitie Apoſtaſie, then it was firſt ſowen in the field of the Church, and not of the wide world.</p>

It is not the will of Chriſt, that Antichriſt and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians, and Antichriſtianitie ſhould be tolerated in the world, untill the end of the world. For God will put it into the hearts of faithfull Princes, (as they have given their Kingdomes to the Beaſt,

                  <hi>In the field of the world then are all thoſe ſorts of grounds, High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſtony, thorney Hearers, as well as the honeſt and good ground. And I ſuppoſe it will not be ſaid by the Anſwerer, that theſe three ſorts of bad grounds were Hypocrites or Tares in the Church.</hi>

For I demand, did not Chriſt himſelfe (who was the chiefe Sower) did not he Preach, and ſow the ſeed of the word to all thoſe foure ſorts of Hearers? And yet he was the Miniſter of Circumciſion, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.) and Preached ſeldome to any, but to Church-Members, Members of the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. It's an error to ſay, The Church conſiſteth of no more ſorts of Hearers, but one, the honeſt and good ground: for if the children of Church-members be in the Church, &amp; of the Church, till they give occaſion of rejection, then they growing up to yeares, become ſome of them like the High-way-ſide, others like the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, others like the Thorney, as well as others like the honeſt and good ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Though it be not the proper work of the Church to attend the proſperitie and flouriſhing of the three ſorts of bad ground, to wit, whileſt they remaine bad: yet it is their worke to ſeek the changing of the bad into good ground, that ſo they may come to proſper and flouriſh. For is it not the proper work of the Church, to bring on their children to become the ſincere People of God, as well as to keep themſelves in that eſtate? Is it not a maine Branch of their Covenant with God, that as God giveth himſelfe to be a God to them, and to their ſeed, ſo they ſhould give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſeed to be his People? Beſides, hath not God given Paſtours and Teachers, as well for the gathering together of the Saints, as for the edification of the body of Chriſt?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is manifeſt, the Lord Jeſus intendeth no other ſort of ſinners in this Parable, (then Antichriſtians) unto whom here he ſaith, let them alone, in Church or State. For then he ſhould contradict other holy and bleſſed Ordinances, for the puniſhment of Offenders, both in Chriſtian and Civill State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> 1. <hi>In the Civill State, God hath armed Parents, Maſters, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to puniſh evill doers, Murderers, Quarrellers, uncleane Perſons, ſtealers, extortioners: ſuch ought not to be let alone, neither in leſſer nor greater Families, Townes, Cities, Kingdomes,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>but ſeaſonably ſuppreſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Kingdome of Chriſt, (whoſe Officers, Lawes, puniſhments, weapons, are all Spirituall and of a Soule-nature) he will not have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Idolaters, Extortioners, Covetous, &amp;c. to be let alone, but the uncleane Lepers to be thruſt forth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore if neither the Offenders againſt the Civill Lawes, State, and Peace, ought to be let alone, nor the Spirituall State, the Church ought to beare with them that are evill,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As all wicked Perſons be oppoſite to Gods children, (for the children of the Kingdome of Light, and the children of the Kingdome of darkneſſe, cannot but be oppoſite;) ſo the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that is in all the wicked againſt the children of God, doth <q>fight againſt the religious ſtate and Kingdome of the Lord Jeſus.</q> For ſuch as ſtand for the Kingdome of Satan, (as all wicked men doe) they ſtand in oppoſition to the Kingdome of Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. It followeth not, that becauſe Chriſt biddeth his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Let the wicked alone in Church or State, That therefore he intendeth no other then Antichriſtian Idolaters: Neither ſhould Chriſt contradict any Ordinance of his own for the puniſhment of Offenders, both in Chriſtian and Civill State, though he ſhould command other offenders to be let alone beſides Antichriſtians. For no Ordinance or Law of God, nor juſt Law of man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the rooting out of hypocrites, either by Civill, or Church-cenſure, though the Church be bound to endeavour as much (as in them lyeth) to heale their hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>

For what if the members of a Chriſtian Church ſhall ſome of them Apoſtate to Antichriſtian Superſtition and Idolatry, (as often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out by the ſeduction of the Emiſſaries of Babel) doth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt binde the hands of the Church (of which they are Members) to let them alone? In chapter 19. The Diſcuſſer himſelf would not have the ſuperſtitious obſervation of Lent-Faſts to be let alone; And ſurely, Chriſt ordained by his bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that if any Brother proved an Idolater, (whether Pagan, or Antichriſtian) ſuch an one ſhould be caſt out by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>Beſides, What if any Antichriſtian Perſons out of zeale to the Catholick Cauſe, and out of conſcience to the command of their

               <p>THirdly, The Tares cannot be hypocrites, is as cleare as the Light, becauſe they, when they are diſcovered, and ſeene to be Tares, are not to be let alone to the Angels in the end of the world, but are to be purged out by the Governours of the Church, with the whole Church.</p>

               <p>This objection hath been anſwered above, and let it be againe denied (till the Diſcuſſer prove the contrary, which will never be) That hypocrites when they appeare to be hypocrites, (and yet no worſe then Tares) are to be purged out by the Government of the Church. It is true, if Hypocrites having a forme of Godlineſſe, and yet denying the power thereof, doe breake forth into ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſcandalous Fruits of Hypocriſie, as tend to the leavening of the whole lumpe, they may then juſtly be proceeded againſt by the Government of the Church.

               <p>Theſe 3. Interpretations of, Let them alone, are all of them ſo many evaſions, (ſlippery evaſions) ſought out by the ſubtile wit of man, to winde out from under the Authority of the Truth, and word of Chriſt,</p>
               <p>For 1. Why ſhould not the Miniſters of Chriſt Pray, either to pluck them up out of their Antichriſtian Idolatryes, or elſe to pluck them up, as the Plantations which our Heavenly Father hath not planted? He that may Pray daily for the comming of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:160232:28"/>Chriſts Kingdome, He may, and doth, and ought to pray for the comming downe of all oppoſite Kingdomes. The Saints under the Altar that prayed againſt the delay of vengeance on the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 6.10.) may more juſtly pray againſt the delay of vengeance on the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſts.</p>
               <p>What though the State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſtians was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſundry ages before their finall extirpation? Yet they were to expect vialls of Gods indignation to roote them out by a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all extirpation in ſundry of their cheife branches, and pillars, long before the extirpation of their whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And what though the Saints in old <hi>Babell</hi> were to pray for the Peace of the City, as wherein themſelves—might finde Peace? Yet the Saints that live not in ſuch An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ichriſtian Territoryes; they may ſafely pray for the haſtning of the redemption of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren out of the Antichriſtian bondage, and there withall pray for the haſtning of the ruine, and deſolation of the Antichriſtian Kingdome</p>
               <p>Beſides, Certaine it is from the Word of Truth, that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdome ſhall be deſtroyed, and rooted up by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes and States long before the great Harveſt of the end of the world, as hath been ſhewen a bove. And either ſuch Princes muſt performe this great worke without Prayer (and then it were not ſanctified to God 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5.) Or if it be a ſacrifice ſanctified to God, they muſt pray for their deſolation before they inflict it. And all the ſeven Angells, who powre out their vialls on the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian State, tending to the rooting of it out by degrees, They either pray for the ſucceſſe of the vengeance of their vialls, or elſe they doe not powre them out in faith: which were contrary to the ſpirit of ſuch holy Saints, <hi>who come out of the Temple opened in Heaven, and are cloathed with pure and white linnen, and have their breaſts girded with golden girdles,</hi> Rev. 15.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle have Prophecied and denounced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and extirpation of Antichriſtian Idolaters, and their whole State, why may not a Miniſter and Meſſenger of Chriſt (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of light received) open thoſe Prophecyes, and apply them with ſevere threatnings, againſt thme and their State?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, but they may not apply, or denounce them to their preſent deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or extirpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:160232:29"/>
               <p>Yes to the preſent deſtruction of ſome or other Antichriſtian Idolaters in every age, though the State may continue (waſting) till the time appointed. It might as truely be ſaid, the Miniſters of Chriſt are forbidden to denounce preſent or ſpeedy deſtruction to any murtherers, whoremongers, Tyrants, extortioners, becauſe though ſome of them, may fall under many ſore and feareful pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues: yet there will never want a company of ſuch wicked doers, till the Great Harveſt, the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Beſides what if a meſſenger of Chriſt ſhould not denounce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſtruction, yet he cannot be ſaid to let them alone, who is hewing at them to bring them to deſtruction many yeares before. It is not every ſtroake with an Axe that felleth an Oake: it may be not an hundred, not a thouſand ſtroakes; yet no ſtroake is loſt that maketh way for the felling of it at the laſt. Neither can he be ſaid to let the Tree alone, that ſtriketh and heweth at it every day. So he that heweth at the Antichriſtian State every day by Prayer, and Preaching. He doth not let it alone, though it may ſtand many a yeare after. It will fall the ſooner, and with more—facility for every ſtroake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor can it be the meaning of Chriſt, in commanding his Miniſters to let the Tares alone, to forbid them to ſtirr up Princes and States, to the rooting out of Antichriſtian Idolaters, and all ſuch falſe worſhippers, as deſtroy the Truth and Religion of the Lord Jeſus. For amongſt all the Angells, that powred out their vials upon the Antichriſtian State, it is not credible, that none of them ſhould be Meſſengers of the Goſpell. And when the ten Kings ſhall burne the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and leave it deſolate and naked, It is not credible that they will doe it without ſome excitement from the Angells, no more then the Angells powred out their vialls, till they were ſtirred up by a great voice out of the Temple, <hi>Revelations,</hi> 16.1.</p>
               <p>It is an evaſion as groundleſſe as the former, that <hi>Elijahs ſtirring up of</hi> Ahab <hi>to kill all the Preiſts and Prophets of Baal, was figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:160232:29"/>of Chriſt: <hi>Aholah</hi> but not <hi>Aholibah.</hi> To make this act in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Type of Chriſts act in Chriſtian State, or Church, is to make darkneſſe a type of light. Ceremoniall Lawes were generally Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall: not ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> his Judicialls, eſpecially thoſe which had in them morall equity.</p>
               <p>It is Morall equity, That Blaſphemers, and Apoſtate Idolaters, ſeducing others to Idolatry, ſhould be put to death, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Ahab</hi> forfited his owne life becauſe he did not put <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> to death for his blaſphemy. 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 20.23, 28. and <hi>ver.</hi> 42. yet <hi>Benhadad</hi> was no <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> nor was his blaſphemy bleched out in the Land of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but the externall equity of that Judiciall Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was of morall force, and bindeth all Princes to expreſſe that zeale, and indignation, both againſt blaſphemy, in ſuch as fall under their juſt power, which <hi>Ahab</hi> neglected; and againſt ſeducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Idolatry, which <hi>Ahab</hi> executed, or elſe <hi>Elijah,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by his conſent.</p>
               <p>But before I leave this diſpute, touching the meaning of thoſe words, Let them alone, let me add another Interpretation, which I ſee doth rather more ſatisfie others, and it may wel ſtand. Let them alone, is not a word of precept by way of Ordinance: But a word of permiſſion by way of Providence. God in his Providence will permit ſome or other Tares ever to be found in his Church to the laſt Judgement. Which yet he would not have his ſervants offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at: For them he will pluck up by his Angells at the laſt Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</p>

               <p>Reply 1. To paſſe by the Aſſertion of the Privacy of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, It is not an Act of courteſie, and loathneſſe to ſtrive, but out of defect of juſt pretence to make any colourable exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. For though the Apoſtles were called to a publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. yet it ſeemeth, not as then to a conſtant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but to a tranſient Adminiſtration <hi>pro illa vice,</hi> for that time. Their conſtant calling required to attend continually upon Chriſts Miniſtry, to prepare and ripen them for the publique conſtant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which they were to be called to, after Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21, 22.</p>
               <p>Beſides in that tranſient Adminiſtration they were not ſent to the Scribes and Phariſes, (who were no bitter then Wolves and Foxes,) <hi>but to the loſt ſheepe of the Houſe of Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 10.6. And therefore the Apoſtles not being ſent to the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, they had no power over them, but ſtood as private men to them.</p>
               <p>Reply 2. And as they had no calling, nor power to correct or cenſure them themſelves: ſo neither had they a calling to excite the civill Magiſtrate againſt them. For firſt it was no juſt cauſe for the civill Magiſtrate to puniſh the Phariſes, for that they tooke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt offence againſt Chriſts wholeſome doctrine.</p>
               <p>For neither was the doctrine it ſelfe a fundamentall truth: nor was their offence againſt it, a fundamentall errour, though it was dangerous. Beſides the civill Magiſtrates had no Law eſtabliſhed about doctrines, or offences of that nature. And therefore they could take no judiciall cognizance of any complaint preſented to them about the ſame.</p>
               <p>Moreover our Saviour who ſent forth his Apoſtles to preach to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> gave them a charge of caution to beware how they medled with Scribes and Phariſes, <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſend you forth as ſheepe among wolves: Be ye therefore wiſe as ſerpents, &amp; innocent as doves, Beware of men, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 10.16, 17.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles therefore having received this caution could not meddle with the Scribes and Phariſes, but treſpaſſe againſt this rule of ſerpentine prudence: as much as for a flocke of lambes to complaine to a kennell of wolves, of the wolves out-rage. Yea, Chriſt himſelfe was ſparing to reprove them himſelfe (though cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:160232:31"/>to a publicke Miniſtery,) till the laſt yeare of his Miniſtery, when his houre was comming of departure out of the world; as knowing, they would not be able to beare it, and their exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have been ſome hinderance to the free paſſage of his Miniſtery, before his houre was come.</p>

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. to <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Pauls</hi> appeale to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was about the wrongs done unto the <hi>Jewes, Acts</hi> 25.10. The wrongs to them were not onely civill, but Church-offences, which <hi>Paul</hi> denied: Neither againſt the Law of the <hi>Jewes</hi> (ſaith he) nor againſt the Temple, nor againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> have I offended any thing at all, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Feſtus</hi> demanded if he would goe up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of theſe things? <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Theſe things were matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as civill offences. To offend againſt the Law of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and againſt the Temple, were offences againſt Religion: to offend againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a civill offence. To be judged of theſe things, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:160232:31"/>declineth the Court at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> (as being unjuſtly prejudiced againſt him:) But profeſſing his owne innocency, and ſubjection to juſt judgement, He appealeth to <hi>Caeſars</hi> judgement ſeate, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. wherein three or foure things doe evidently appeare.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a man may be ſuch an offender in matters of Religion (againſt the Law of God, againſt the Church, as well as in civill matters againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi>) as to be worthy of death.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Paul</hi> preſuppoſeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other ſuch like ſervant of Chriſt, If he ſhould commit any ſuch offence, he would not refuſe judgement unto death, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That for the Judgement of his perſon in theſe cauſes, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eccleſiaſticall or civill,) It is lawfull in ſome caſes to appeale, to a civill, though a <hi>Pagan</hi> Magiſtrate. In ſome caſes I ſay, as where both theſe concurre, to wit. 1. That Church-officers, are maliciouſly prejudiced againſt a man, and inferiour civil Courts incline to them. 2. That a man be called in queſtion amongſt them in capitall cauſes, which concerne his life.</p>
               <p>But a fourth thing which appeareth from <hi>Pauls</hi> appeale is this, That the civill Magiſtrate, whether <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> may and ought to be ſo well acquainted, not onely with civill cauſes, but alſo with cauſes of Religion, eſpecially ſuch as concerne life, as to be able to judge, though not of all queſtions, yet of capitall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, againſt Religion, as well as againſt the civill State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 2. to <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. The Marginall Note, ſeemeth to imply a contradiction to it ſelfe, for thus it ſpeaketh, <hi>Civill Magiſtrates were never appointed by God, Defenders of the Faith of Jeſus.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Every one is bound to put forth himſelfe to his utmoſt power in Gods Buſineſſe:</hi> Surely, if every one be bound to put forth himſelfe to his utmoſt power in Gods Buſineſſe, then civill Magiſtrates are bound to put forth their civill power, in defending the Faith of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Neither will it henceforth follow, That either Chriſt, or his Diſciples were bound to complaine to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or to <hi>Herod,</hi> or to <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> againſt the Hereſies of the Phariſes. For though all Magiſtrates, even <hi>Pagans</hi> ought to informe themſelves in the matters of Faith and of Chriſtian Religion, (that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and preſerve it) and it will be a deſtructive ſinne to them and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:160232:32"/>their States, if they doe neglect it, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.) Yet it may be ſafer for a Chriſtian man being oppreſſed in inferiour Courts of hereticall malignant Judges to appeale from them unto <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes in his owne juſt defence, then to make complaint to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant hereticall Judges, or to <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes, againſt hereſies, or hereticall falſe Teacliers. Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples, as ſheepe amongſt wolves: and therefore inſtructed them, <hi>to be wiſe as ſerpents, and innocent as doves, Matth.</hi> 10.16. Now it is no part of wiſedome for a ſheepe of Chriſt to complaine to a kennell of wolves, That amongſt the wolves, there be ſome of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany doe make havocke of the ſheepe, leading them aſide into damnable hereſies. If a poore ſheepe ſhould attempt ſuch a thing, would not the whole kennell of wolves ariſe up againſt him, as a troubler of their State, that when he enjoyeth peace himſelfe, (they trouble not him,) yet he will needes be ſo buſie as to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them?</p>
               <p>And therefore we deny, that it had tended to the defence of the Faith of Jeſus, or to the ſuppreſſing Heriſies, for Chriſt and his Diſciples to have complained to <hi>Herod, Pilate, Caeſar,</hi> of the hereſies of the Phariſes. It had rather tended to the diſturbance and ſuppreſſion of the Faith of Jeſus, by provoking the malice of the Phariſes, and by diſquieting civill Thrones with feares and jealouſies of a new Kingdome ſpringing up amongſt them.

For ſo much the very phraſe of nurſing Fathers, and Mothers, doth neceſſarily import. But if they be Protectours of the Church, and providers of the well-being of it, then are they alſo Defenders of the faith of it: ſo farre as their defence (in a way of God) is diſpenſable. So Magiſtrates are alſo called Shepheards of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (as well as Miniſters) <hi>Ezec.</hi> 34. Now it is a part of a Shepheards protection of his ſheepe, to drive away wolves from ſheepe-folds.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a three-fold Judgement. 1. A Judgement of private ſpirituall Diſcretion: and ſo <hi>a ſpirituall man judgeth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. and ſo may a Magiſtrate judge alſo, if he be a ſpirituall man.</p>

                  <hi>Subordinata,</hi> and ſo <hi>Coordinata non pugnant.</hi> It is true, Chriſt hath appointed ſpirituall meanes for the avoiding and preventing the infection of hereſies; ſo hath he alſo for the preventing and avoiding all offences in Church-members. But that hindreth not the lawfull and neceſſary uſe of a civill ſword for the puniſhment of ſome ſuch offences, as are ſubject to Church-cenſure. If indeed the Ordinances of Chriſt in the Church doe prevaile to the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and healing of hereſies, there is no need of the civill ſword for that end. But it often falleth out otherwiſe: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when the Church hath caſt out an Heretick, yet he ſtill remaineth obſtinate, and proceedeth to ſeduce, and deſtroy the faith of ſome, (it may be of many:) as did <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17, 18.

And therefore it cannot truely be ſaid, that the Lord Jeſus never appointed the civill ſword for a remedy in ſuch a caſe. For he did expreſſely appoint it in the Old-Teſtament: nor did he ever abrogate it in the New. The reaſon of the Law, (which is the life of the Law) is of eternall force and equity in all Ages. <hi>Thou ſhult ſurely kill him, becauſe be hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God, Deut.</hi> 13.9, 10.

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If it were true, That the Magiſtrate hath charge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the bodies and goods of the Subject: yet that might iuſtly excite to watchfulneſſe againſt ſuch pollutions of Religion as tend to Apoſtacy. For if the Church and People of God, fall away from God, God will viſit the City and Countrey with publicke calamity, if not captivity for the Churches ſake. The Idolatry and Image-worſhip of Chriſtians, brought in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Cities and Countryes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and upon ſome of <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, as hath been ſhewed above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 2. It is a carnall and worldly, and indeed, an ungodly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:160232:36"/>imagination, to confine the Magiſtrates charge, to the bodies, and goods of the Subiect, and to exclude them from the care of their ſoules. Did ever God commit the charge of the body to any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, to whom, he did not commit (in his way) the care of ſoules alſo? Hath God committed to Parents the charge of their childrens bodies, and not the care of their ſoules? To Maſters the charge of their ſervants bodies, and not of their ſoules? to Captaines the charge of their ſouldiers bodies, and not of their ſoules? ſhall the Captaines ſuffer falſe worſhip, yea idolatry, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profeſſed and practiſed in the campe, and yet looke to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Battell? The Magiſtrates to whom God hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the charge of bodies, and outward man of the Subiect, are they not alſo to take care to procure faithfull Teachers to be ſent amongſt them? <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> tooke faithfull care for the ſoules of his people in this kind, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9. Neither did he this as a Type of Chriſt, but as a Servant of Chriſt. Thoſe things are ſaid to be done as Types of Chriſt, which being ceremoniall duties, were afterwards done by Chriſt in his owne Perſon, and ſo were in him accompliſhed, and aboliſhed: And it would be ſacriledge to performe the ſame after him. But let the conſcience of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian iudge, whether it would be ſacriledge in a godly Magiſtrate, to procure the ſending forth of godly Preachers into all the blind corners of his countrey? The truth is, Church-Governous, and civill-governours doe herein ſtand paralell one to another. The Chuch-Governours though to them be chiefely committed the charge of ſoules, as their adaequate obiects: yet in order to the good of the ſoules of their people, to dehort from idleneſſe, negligence, from intemperancy in meates and drinkes, from oppreſſion, and deceit, and therein provide both for the health of their bodies, and the ſafety of their eſtates. So civill-governours though to them be chiefely committed the bodies and goods of the people (as their adaequate obiect:) yet in order to this, they may and ought to procure ſpirituall helpes to their ſoules, and to prevent ſuch ſpirituall evills, as that the proſperity of Religion amongſt them might advance the proſperity of the civill State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 3. I cannot but with griefe obſerve the ſinfull guile of the Diſcuſſer: who whileſt he taketh off all charges of ſoules from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:160232:36"/>the civill Magiſtrates, and layeth it upon Church-Governours, he taketh it off from Church-Governours too, that ſo the whole charge of precious ſoules (for whom Chriſt dyed) might utterly fall to the ground. For how ſhall Church-Governours take the charge of ſoules upon them, if there be no Church-Governours? And how ſhall there be Church-Governours, where there be no Churches? If Churches be all diſſipated and rooted out from the face of the Earth by the Apoſtacy of Antichriſt, and none to be gathered againe, till new Apoſtles or Evangeliſts be ſent abroad for ſuch a worke, then there be now neither Churches, nor Church-Governours, nor Church-cenſures, either to cenſure He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, or to fetch in thoſe ſtray ſoules whom they have ſcatter'd. And then rejoyce yee Hereticks, and all yee Idolaters, and Seducers, and goe on, and make havock of the ſheep of Chriſt like ravenous Wolves: you may now doe it <hi>(impunè)</hi> without feare or danger; It is neither for Civill Governours, nor Church-Governours to meddle with you; Not for Civill Governours, for they are not to judge nor puniſh in matters of Religion: Nor for Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, for there are neither Churches, nor Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours extant now upon the face of the Earth. But woe be to you poore ſheepe and Lambes of Chriſt Jeſus: you are now indeed truly become the <hi>ſheep of the ſlaughter, your Poſſeſſours may ſlay you, and plead themſelves not guilty,</hi> (<hi>Zach.</hi> 11.4, 5.) not guilty before the Civill Barre: for their crime is exempted from civill cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance: not guilty before the Churches Tribunall: for there be no Churches to call them to account.</p>

               <p>It followeth not: unleſſe the Magiſtrate were to puniſh them with Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, which he neither doth, nor may doe. The puniſhments which he inflicteth on them, are meerely Civill, whether impriſonment, baniſhment, or death.</p>

                  <hi>That Doctrine and diſtinction, that a Magiſtrate may puniſh an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick civilly, will not here avayle. For what is</hi> Babell, <hi>if this be not? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly to puniſh Corporall, or Civill offences, with ſpirituall, or Church-cenſures (the offender not being a member of it:) or to puniſh ſoule or ſpirituall offences, with Corporall or Temporall weapons proper to Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents againſt the Civill State.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>It is no <hi>Babell,</hi> or Babiloniſh confuſion to puniſh corporall, or civill offences, with Spirituall or Church-cenſures. What if a Brother be a ſtriker, an oppreſſour, a murderer, a fornicator, or Adulterer? all theſe are corporall, and civill offences. But ſhall not therefore the Church puniſh theſe with ſpirituall, and Church-cenſures? Then the Apoſtle was miſtaken, who directeth ſo to doe, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.11. why the Diſcuſſer putteth in that parentheſis (the offender not being a member of it:) I cannot tell: ſure I am, it is nothing to the purpoſe. For as the Church cannot puniſh any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, unleſſe he be a member of the Church, ſo neither may the Civill Magiſtrate puniſh an Heretick or other ſpirituall offendor, unleſſe he be a member of his Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And if it be no confuſion to puniſh civill offences with Church-cenſures, it is no confuſion to puniſh ſpirituall offences with civill cenſures. And the reaſon of both theſe is the ſame, there be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry civill offences, which are alſo tranſgreſſions of the Rule of the word, and ſo offences to the Conſciences of the Church, and ſo juſtly ſubject to Church-cenſure. There be alſo offences to the Order and peace of the Church, which tend likewiſe to provoke wrath againſt a Civill State. As the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is commanded by the God of Heaven for the Houſe of God, let it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diligently done: for why ſhould there bewrath againſt the King and his Sonnes?</hi> Ezra 7.3.

But to ſee all his Subjects, Chriſtians, to keep ſuch a Church, or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the purity of worſhip, and ſee them doe their duty, this belongeth to the head of the body the Lord Jeſus, and ſuch ſpirituall Officers, as he hath to this purpoſe deputed.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. What Reaſon can the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> give why the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould breake the teeth of the Lyons, who offer civill vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Church and Saints, and not breake the teeth of the ravenous wolves (falſe Prophets) who offer violence to their ſoules? Doubtleſſe thoſe ravenous wolves, that make havock of their ſoules, are farre more miſchievous then the Lyons be, that offer violence to their bodies. The Romane pagan Emperours (who like Lions perſecuted the Church, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17.) they by perſecution increaſed it, though againſt their wills. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Popiſh Biſhops, that like ravenous wolves devoured their ſoules, left the Church of Chriſt ſcarce viſible, (though viſible) and them, a very ſmall remnant, though a remnant. It may be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:160232:38"/>matter of juſt wonderment, why Antichriſt ſhould find more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the <hi>Diſcuſſers</hi> eyes, then an ignorant Pagan, when the one hateth Chriſt more bitterly, and maketh farre more waſte of the Church, and Saints of Chriſt, then doth the other. Is it becauſe his owne Spirit doth more ſymbolize with Antichriſt then with <hi>Caeſar?</hi> Rather in ſecret ſupplanting, then in open perſecuting the Churches and Ordinances of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beply.</hi> 3. We doe not ſay that it is a part of the Magiſtrates du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſee all his Subjects to become Chriſtians, if they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans before: though wee ſay, it is his Duty to neglect no good meanes to help them onward to the knowledge and faith of Chriſt Jeſus. But why doth the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſhake this duty out of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to ſee that the Church, and the Chriſtians under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould walke in purity of worſhip,</hi> at leaſt not ſo farre to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and apoſtate as to provoke Chriſt to depart from them? Can he hope that ſuch Chriſtians will be faithfull and loyall to their Prince, whom he ſeeth to grow falſe and diſloyall to their God? Surely the Land of <hi>Iſmael</hi> though it had ſome peculiar and and typicall Holineſſe belonging to it, yet no other then what did prefigure the Holineſſe of the Church, which is as holy to Chriſt, and ought to be as holy to us, as the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to them. If therefore it was the duty of <hi>Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to reduce the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their backſlidings, becauſe they were an holy people, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.4.) Surely the like Duty lyeth upon all Godly Chriſtian Princes, to reduce their backſliding Churches to their Primitive Purity.</p>
               <p>Let no man ſay, that as the Holy Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was a Type of Holy Church: So theſe Princes were <hi>Types of the Lord Jeſus, to whom alone it belongeth to ſee Churches and Chriſtians to doe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Purity of worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were Types of Chriſt, (and ſo the Scripture holdeth them forth:) yet the Scripture giveth no hint, that the other Kings either of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>Judah</hi> were Types. Not of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for they were all Apoſtates: nor of <hi>Judah,</hi> for if the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (as Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> to wit, in reſpect of their Regall Eſtate over the Church) if they were all of them Types of Chriſt, then Apoſtates from Chriſt, were Types of Chriſt. For many of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were Apoſtates from Chriſt as well as the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:160232:38"/>
               <p>Yea, if they were all Types of Chriſt, then Chriſt is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, and by accompliſhing ſuch types, hath aboliſhed them all: ſo that now it were ſacrilegious and Antichriſtian uſurpation for any Kings to be ſet over Chriſtians, or the people of God. For the Body being come, Types and ſhadowes vaniſh.</p>
               <p>But what if they were all types of Chriſt in reſpect of their Kingly office over the Church alone? were they therefore types of Chriſt in all the Kingly Offices which they performed? Then it was typicall in <hi>Solomon</hi> to put <hi>Joab</hi> a Murderer to death, and <hi>Adonijab</hi> a Traytor. And then it will be unlawfull for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes to put Murderers or Traitors to death.</p>
               <p>Or if you ſay theſe were civill crimes: But Idolatry and Hereſie, which <hi>Aſa, Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> puniſhed with death, were ſpirituall crimes, and therefore the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> in puniſhing theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were types of Chriſt, not ſo in the former: this is ſpoken <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> For whatſoever the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> did, as types of Chriſt, Chriſt, being the Antitype, might more full, and lively performe it in his owne perſon. But certaine it is, he put no man to death in his owne perſon, all the dayes of his fleſh. Why therefore may it not rather be ſaid, that whatſoever the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> lawfully did, whether againſt the Tranſgreſſours of the firſt or ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they did it not as types of Chriſt, but as ſervants of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the care of the welfare both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and therefore as patternes and examples to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrates?</p>
               <p>And indeed many of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they were Kings over a Common-wealth, which was alſo a Church, ſo they were Kings alſo over ſundry Pagan Nations round about them, as were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Aſa</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat, Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Joſiah.</hi> And though none of them compelled the Pagan Nations, to become Proſelites to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (no more then Chriſtian Kings may compell Pagans to become Chriſtians, or men without to become Church-members) yet <hi>Ahab,</hi> though King over an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Church, having gotten Pagan <hi>Benhadad</hi> by conqueſt under his Dominion, becauſe he put him not to death for his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, forfeited his owne life for his, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.23. with 42.</p>

                  <hi>THe next Scripture brought by the Letter againſt ſuch Perſecution, is</hi> Luke, 9.54, 55. <hi>where the Lord Jeſus reproved his Diſciples, who would have fire come downe from Heaven, to have devoured thoſe Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, that would not receive him, in theſe words,</hi> You know not of what ſpirit you are, the Sonne of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives but to ſave them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Both theſe are directions to Miniſters of the Goſpel, how to deale, (not with obſtinate offenders in the Church, but) either with men without, as the Samaritans were, and many unconverted Chriſtians in</hi> Creete, <hi>whom</hi> Titus <hi>(as an Evangeliſt) was to ſeeke to convert.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly, when the Anſwerer ſaith, much leſſe doth this Text ſpeake at all to the civill Magiſtrate: here I obſerve, that he implyeth, that beſide the cenſure of the Lord Jeſus in the hands of his ſpirituall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, for any ſpirituall evill, in Life or Doctrine, the civill Magiſtrate is alſo to inflict corporall puniſhment.</hi>

               <p>This obſervation I may truly ſay is ravelled out of my Anſwer, and that ſo perplexedly, that it cannot be wound up out of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer without breaking the threed, both of my words, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It is a plaine and certaine Truth, that as the Diſciples were not civill Magiſtrates, ſo neither doth Chriſt ſpeake to them in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:160232:40"/>this Reproofe as to ſuch. But it is farre from me to ſay, that it is lawfull for civill Magiſtrates to inflict corporall puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men contrary minded, ſtanding in the ſame ſtate the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans did. No ſuch thought aroſe in my heart, nor fell from my pen, either in my Anſwer to the Letter, or in any writing of mine, that it is lawfull for a Civill Magiſtrate (though he had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over Pagans, much leſſe if he have none) to inflict corporall puniſhments upon ſuch as are contrary minded in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. No, theſe are ravellings of a looſe and ungirt diſputer, not the Inferences of a ſerious and ſolid <hi>Diſcuſſer.</hi> And therefore the Reaſons which he bringeth in the Sequele of this chapter, that the Magiſtrates ſhould not lay violent hands upon any (ſuch as the Samaritanes) for not receiving of the Lord Jeſus, might well have been ſpared: for they fight not againſt me, but againſt a ſhadow of his owne fancy.</p>
               <p>But when he maketh the Fire that fell downe from Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.13. <hi>to be the fiery Judgements and perſecutions, which the ſecond Beast perſwaded the civill Powers, to deſtroy the Saints withall, as if they were Gods juſt Judgements from Heaven upon Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſuch an Interpretation, as ravelleth the Text, and will not ſtand with the Context. For the Text ſpeaketh of it, as a great wonder, that the Beaſt ſhould <hi>make Fire to come downe from Heaven upon Earth in the ſight of men,</hi> ver. 13. But this was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cauſe civill Powers to inflict fiery Judgements of Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Baniſhment, Death upon Hereticks; for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had done as much before.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops had cauſed <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to doe as much againſt the Orthodox Saints. Beſides in the Context, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. It is expreſſely there declared as a diſtinct matter from the former, that he had <hi>Power to cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt, ſhould he killed.</hi> This is a different effect (and recorded as different) from the former of cauſing fire to come downe from Heaven, and that, not upon the Saints, but upon Earth.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. When we come to thoſe Arguments truly, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collected out of this place of <hi>Timothy</hi> (which is not till the next chapter) we ſhall, (God willing) conſider what Truth and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they hold forth: which if it be found, wee ſhall conſider, whether they be of force againſt the Truth witneſſed by me.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, for Anſwer to his demand, <hi>what I ſhould meane, by the unconverted Chriſtian in Creete?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt take it upon his credit, that I ſpake at all of any unconverted Chriſtian in <hi>Creete.</hi> Mine owne copy is not extant with me. And the Tranſcript, which with much ſeeking, I found, hath it, inſtead of unconverted Chriſtians in <hi>Creete,</hi> unconverted perſons in <hi>Epheſus.</hi> As indeed <hi>Timothy</hi> was left at <hi>Epheſus</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to him his firſt Epiſtle, as is evident, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Titus</hi> it was, who was left at <hi>Creete, Tit.</hi> 1.5. But whether <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:160232:41"/>was then at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to him, is not ſo certaine. But whereſoever he was (as being an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, he was not limited to a certaine place) doubtleſſe there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not unconverted perſons, amongſt whom the Members of the Church lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, but they were not unconverted Chriſtians, for it is as much, as unconverted Converts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt lye upon the Diſcuſſers credit, whether I uſed at all ſuch a phraſe or no: ſure I am, I cannot hitherto (after much ſeeking) find mine owne hand-written copy, which might cleare the miſtake, both of <hi>Creet</hi> for <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and unconverted Chriſtians for unconverted Perſons.</p>
               <p>But let it not ſeeme ſtrange to him, to heare tell of unconverted Chriſtians, or unconverted Converts. There is no contradiction at all in the words. When the Lord ſaith, that <hi>Judah turned unto him, not with all her heart, but fainedly,</hi> (Jer. 3.10.) Was ſhe not then an unconverted Convert? converted in ſhew and profeſſion, but unconverted in heart and Truth? Let him then conſider his own phraſe here miſapplyed, whether this be the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the Language of <hi>Aſhdod. Jeremies</hi> Language is the Language of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> not of <hi>Aſhdod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. If the Diſcuſſer looke at it as a true, <hi>but ſad experience of my unconverted eſtate, from unconverted Churches, and that the Lord Jeſus never yet called me to come out of them, becauſe I ſpeake</hi> (if I doe ſo ſpeake) of unconverted Chriſtians living amongſt them.</p>
               <p>I muſt be contented ſtill to lie under that imputation from him. I never knew that Church yet, nor ever read of it, in which there was not, (or at leaſt might not) be found, ſome unconverted Chriſtians, unconverted Converts. <hi>Judas</hi> was found in Chriſts Family: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> in the Apoſtolick Primitive Church: <hi>Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> were found in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Jeſabel</hi> in <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides I have not yet learned, (nor doe I thinke, I ever ſhall) that the children of beleiving Parents borne in the Church, are all of them Pagans, and no Members of the Church: or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Members of the Church, (&amp; ſo holy) that they are all of them truly converted. And if they be not alwayes truly converted, then let him not wonder, nor ſtumble at the phraſe of unconverted Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:160232:41"/>
               <p>But if the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> doe ſadly obſerve it, that my <hi>ſoule hath not yet heard the call of the Lord Jeſus to come out of unconverted Churches:</hi> truly I have juſt cauſe (not without ſadneſſe and mourning) to conſider, and to pray, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what call of the Lord Jeſus his ſoule hath heard to come out, not onely out of unconverted Churches, but converted too, yea out of all Churches?</p>

                  <hi>Againe, I obſerve the haſte and light attention of the Anſwerer, to theſe Scriptures (as commonly the Spirits of Gods children in matters of Gods Kingdome, are very ſleepy:) for theſe perſons here ſpoken of were not unconverted Chriſtians in</hi> Creete, <hi>whom</hi> Titus <hi>as an Evnngeliſt was to convert, but they were ſuch Oppoſites, as</hi> Timothy (<hi>to whom</hi> Paul <hi>writeth this Letter at</hi> Epheſus) <hi>ſhould not meet withall.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whether ſuch words be found in the copy of my Anſwer to the Letter, I leave it to the <hi>Diſcuſſers</hi> credit. As I ſaid even now, mine owne copy I cannot (after much diligent ſearch) finde: the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript which I have found hath it otherwiſe, the unconverted Perſons in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whom <hi>Timothy</hi> as an Evangeliſt was to ſeeke, to convert. But if my copy doe ſpeake as he reporteth:</p>
               <p>Then, 1. I doe not deny, but have juſt cauſe to acknowledge mine owne haſte, and light attention, and ſleepineſſe in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſts Kingdome, not onely in this paſſage: but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently elſe in the race of my Chriſtian courſe of life. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves Chriſt found ſleepy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.40. how much more may he find me ſleepy?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> might have imputed it as well, to my haſt to gratifie his earneſt deſire to Anſwer his friends Letter, and to my confidence in his love, that for haſt to ſatisfie him, miſtooke one place and perſon for another, and was not ſo attentive to peruſe and examine the copy ſent by me to him, as I would have been, had I ſent it to an Adverſary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The caſe is all one in the matters of Chriſts Kingdome, whether I had named <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Titus, Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Creete:</hi> For the perſons were both of them Evangeliſts, and the places of them both ſuch, as had unconverted perſons in them, and (like enough) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Chriſtians too: <hi>Epheſus</hi> had evill perſons amongſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:160232:42"/>them, whom they could not beare, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.) as well as <hi>Creet</hi> had amongſt them ſuch as were <hi>alwayes lyars, evill Beaſts, ſlow bellies, Tit.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> that obſerveth haſte, and light attention, and ſleepineſſe in another, one would thinke, would be more vigilant, and attentive himſelfe. He that ſaith (as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> doth in his parentheſis) that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Letter, (to wit, his ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle) to <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> taketh it for granted, that which without ſome haſty lightneſſe, even the ſame, which he blameth in my ſelfe, he cannot beleive, that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his ſecond to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> There is no word in the Epiſtle, that ſpeaketh of <hi>Timothies</hi> being at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that ſecond Epiſtle. His calling of an Evangeliſt did not permit him to tarry long in a place: and the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> is thought by the Learned to have been written one of the firſt of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe of the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> But the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written laſt of all the Epiſtles, when <hi>Pauls</hi> time of departure was at hand, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. And when <hi>Paul</hi> writeth 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4.12. that he had ſent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> It is not likely, he would have written ſo to <hi>Timothy,</hi> if <hi>Timothy</hi> then had been at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> For <hi>Timothy</hi> would have knowne, that <hi>Tychycus</hi> had been at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> or if <hi>Tychicus</hi> had been then but on his way to <hi>Epheſus</hi> (which is a narrow point of time) it is more then propable, if <hi>Timothy</hi> had been then at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he would have ſaid, <hi>Tychicus have I ſent to thee to Epheſus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the Civill Magiſtrates be Chriſtians or Members of the Church, able to propheſie to the Church of Chriſt; then they are bound by this command of Chriſt, to ſuffer oppoſition to their Doctrine, with meekneſſe and gentleneſſe, waiting if God peradventure will give them Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So alſo it pleaſeth the Anſwerer to acknowledge in theſe words: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:160232:42"/>not the ſpirit of the Goſpel to convert Aliens to the Faith (ſuch as the Samaritans and unconverted perſons, whether in</hi> Epheſus, <hi>or</hi> Creete) <hi>with Fire and Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwerer is ſtill of the ſame mind, though he might ſtrike in upon the advantage, that if the Magiſtrate be alſo a Prophet, he may doe ſome things as a Magiſtrate, which he may not doe as a Prophet: yet he willingly acknowledgeth, that if a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate be alſo a Prophet (yea, whether he be a Prophet, or no) he ought not to ſeeke to ſubdue, and convert Aliens to the Faith, by Fire and Sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Diſcuſſer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, if the Oppoſitions be within, and the Church-members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcandalous in Doctrine (I ſpeake not of ſcandalls in the Civill State, which the civill Magiſtrate ought to puniſh.) It is the Lord onely</hi> (<hi>as the Scripture in</hi> Timothy <hi>implyeth</hi>) <hi>who is able to give them Repentance, and to recover them out of Satans ſnare, &amp;c. It is true, the civill Sword may make a whole Nation of Hypocrites, as the Lord complaineth,</hi> Iſay 10. <hi>and as befell our Native Country in a few ſcores of yeares, in the ſeverall Reignes of</hi> Henry 7. Henry 8. <hi>King</hi> Edward, <hi>Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>Queene</hi> Elizabeth; <hi>under whom our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was as ready to change the faſhion of their Religions, as of their Suits of Apparell, which hath been their ſinfull ſhame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>If Oppoſition riſe from within, from the Members of the Church, I doe not beleive it to be lawfull for the Magiſtrate to ſeeke to ſubdue, and convert them to be of his mind by the civill Sword: But rather to uſe all ſpirituall meanes for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and converſion. But if the Oppoſition ſtill continue in Doctrine and Worſhip, and that againſt the vitals, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls of Religion (whether by Hereſie of Doctrine, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in Worſhip) and ſhall proceed to ſeeke the Seduction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I doe beleive the Magiſtrate is not to tolerate ſuch oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Truth in Church-members, or in any Profeſſours of the Truth after due conviction from the word of Truth. Nor is it an <hi>Objection of any weight, that neither the Magiſtrate, nor his Sword can give Repentance unto ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For neither can he give Repentance unto ſuch perſons as are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:160232:43"/>ſcandalous to the civill State, whom yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth the civill Magiſtrate ought to puniſh. Though the civill Sword ſhould not make the oppoſers Hypocrites, yet better tolerate Hypocrites and Tares, then Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Thornes. In ſuch caſes the civill Sword doth not ſo much attend the converſion of wicked Seducers, as the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeduction of honeſt minds by their meanes.</p>
               <p>What the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> have done in former, or later times, either by violent Perſecution of the Truth, or in prepoſterous maintenance of the Truth, we have cauſe rather to bewaile it: (and ſo hath the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> too, if he be an <hi>Engliſh man</hi>) then to juſtifie it: as alſo bewaile the like vanity juſtly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of in ſundry of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to be as ready to change the faſhion of their Religion, as of their Rayment. And yet he cannot be ignorant, that the Lord hath choſen to himſelfe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry faithfull witneſſes out of that Nation, who have continued ſtedfaſt unto the death in the Profeſſion of the Truth, and have not been carried away, either with the feare of civill Sword, or with the deceitfull inſinuations of unſtable but ſeducing Teachers, to depart from the ſimplicity and Truth of the Goſpel. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wofull, and wonderfull changes have been made of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>England,</hi> in the Reigne of foure or five Princes, yet it is no more then befell the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah, Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> yet the Prophets never upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with the civill Magiſtrater Power in cauſes of Religion, as the cauſe of it. Better ſome viciſſitudes in Religion, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant continuance in Idolatry, and Popery, by Princes referring all cauſes of Religion to Church-men.

What though a dead ſoule, though changed from one Worſhip to another, <hi>(like a dead man ſhifted into ſeverall ſuites of Apparell) cannot pleaſe God?</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>And what though Faith be that gift, which proceedeth alone from that Father of Lights?</hi> Phil. 1.29.</p>
               <p>Yet better a dead ſoule be dead in body, as well as in Spirit, then to live, and be lively in the fleſh, to murder many precious ſoules by the Magiſtrates Indulgence. And better he die without Faith, then to live to ſeduce many honeſt minds to depart from the Faith.</p>

               <p>It hath been declared above, that we doe not hold it lawfull, to conſtraine by Civill Sword, Jewes, or Turkes, or Antichriſtians to be of our Religion, whether they be good Subjects, loving Neighbours, faire dealers, yea or no.

               <p>Now if Church-members ſhould Apoſtate from Chriſt, and of Chriſtians become Jewes, and Turkes, and Antichriſtians, and draw away Diſciples after them, I would demand of any man (whoſe Conſcience is not paſt feeling of the danger of damnable Hereſies) whether ſuch <hi>Members may goe for peaceable and quiet Subjects, for loving and helpfull Neighbours, for faire and juſt dealers, for true and Loyall to the civill Government?</hi> If thoſe be peaceable, and quiet Subjects, that withdraw Subjects from Subjection to Chriſt: if they be loving and helpfull Neighbours, that help men on to perdition: If they be faire and juſt dealers, that wound the ſoules of the beſt, and kill and deſtroy the ſoules of many, if ſuch be true and loyall to Civill Government, that ſubject it to the Tyranny of a forraine Prelate, then it will be no advantage to civill States, when the Kingdomes of the Earth ſhall become the

               <p>This Condition if (in civill things peaceable and obedient) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a contradiction to the nature and practice of wolves.

               <p>Beſides for another example, and that approved, you find in the Lords Teſtament, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6, 7. of which before. And for a word of command from Chriſt, to meddle with wolves, that grand charter, whereby Magiſtrates are eſtabliſhed in the new Teſtament, may abundantly ſuffice, The Magiſtrate is the Miniſter of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.</p>
               <p>If the wolfe be an evill doer, let him looke at the Magiſtrate as appointed of God to be an avenger, and executor of wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Say not, yea, if the wolfe be an evill doer againſt the ſecond Table, but not ſo, if againſt the firſt Table: or if an evill doer againſt the bodies and eſtates of men, not ſo, if againſt their ſoules.</p>
               <p>For who gave any man commiſſion ſo to limit the word of God, or the power of the Magiſtrate? Beſides it hath been often ſaid, that he that goeth about to ſubvert Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſoules, is an evill doer againſt the peace of the Civill State.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>If God had given charge to Magiſtrates to puniſh evill doers in matters of Religion, he would have given to Magiſtrates in the world, ability to diſcerne, and determine, who are ſheep, and who are wolviſh oppreſſors, whom he is bound to puniſh and ſuppreſſe.

               </p>
               <p>It hath been declared above, that Magiſtrates ought to be ſo well accquainted with matters of Religion, as to diſcerne the Fundamentall Principels thereof, and the evill of choſe hereſies and Blaſphemies, as doe ſubvert the ſame.

               <p>It doth not Anſwer that Objection.

               <p>They were furniſhed with ſufficient power to caſt them out of the Church, but being caſt out, they had not ſufficient power to drive them away from conferring with, and corrupting the members of the Church, or other Godly ones out of the Church.

                  <hi>Is not this to take Chriſt, and to make him a temporal King by force?</hi> Joh. 6.15. <hi>Is not this to make his Kingdome of this world? to ſet up a Civill and Temporall</hi> Iſrael? <hi>to bound out new earthly holy lands of</hi> Canaan? <hi>yea and to ſet up a Spaniſh Inquiſition in all parts of the world, to the ſpeedy deſtruction of millions of ſoules, and to the fruſtrating of the ſweet end of the comming of the Lord Jeſus, which was to ſave mens ſoules (and to that end, not to deſtroy their bodyes) by his owne bloud?</hi>

               <p>Now of all theſe: when the Kingdomes of the earth become the Kingdomes of the Lord (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15.) It is not, by making Chriſt a temporall King, but by making temporall Kingdomes nurſing Fathers to his Church. In the dayes of Chriſts Fleſh it was Incompatible to his Miniſtery to make him a King (as they went about to doe <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.15.) Chriſt hath injoyed (even as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator) an everlaſting Kingdome, not onely in the Church, but in the Government of all the Kingdomes of the earth, by his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power, and righteouſneſſe. But the Kingdomes of the earth are then ſaid to be the Kingdomes of our Lord, when they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their lawes to the lawes of his word. But that neither maketh him a temporall King, nor his Kingdome in the Church to be a Kingdome of this world. The Church and Common-wealth are ſtill diſtinct Kingdomes, the one of this world, the other of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:160232:48"/>Heaven: and yet both of them from Chriſt; unto whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath committed all Judgement, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p>Neither will this ſet up a Civill and temporall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> an holy <hi>Canaan,</hi> unleſſe all the members of the Common-wealth were called to be members of the Church, and ſubject to all the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, and all the judiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> (not onely thoſe of Morall, and perpetuall equity,) but peculiar to that State, as the Brother to marry his deceaſed Brothers wife.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a Spaniſh Inquiſition, to preſerve the ſheep of Chriſt from the raven of wolves: but this rather, (ſuch is the practiſe of the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi>) to promote the principal end of the ſpaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, to advance the Romiſh tyranny, Idolatry, and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by proclaiming impunity to all their whoriſh and wolviſh Emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a fruſtrating of the ſweet end of Chriſts comming, which was to ſave ſoules, but rather a direct advancing of it, to deſtroy (if need be) the bodies of thoſe wolves, who ſeeke to deſtroy the ſoules of thoſe, for whom Chriſt died, and whom he bought with his owne bloud.</p>

                  <hi>To which it is Anſwered,</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaketh of the weapons of Apoſtles, and Church-Officers, which are not carnall, but ſpirituall: and mighty through God. But this denieth not, Civill weapous of Justice to Civill Magiſtrates. But I here obſerve, that the Scripture holdeth forth a two-fold State, a Civill State, and a Spirituall: Civill Officers, and ſpirituall: Civill weapons, and ſpirituall: Civill vengeance, and ſpirituall: though the Spirit ſpeaketh not here expreſly of Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and their Civill weapons: yet theſe States being of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and conſiderations (as farre differing as fleſh and ſpirit) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Civill weapons are moſt improper and unfitting in matters of the

               <p>The Diſcuſſer, as often throughout his Diſcourſe, ſo here he looſeth himſelfe, and the truth, in ambiguityes. Civill weapons are indeed improper, and unfitting in ſpirituall matters, to wit, in the diſpencing, and preſſing of ſpirituall matters for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate producing of ſpirituall ends, as for a Magiſtrate to draw his ſword to compell all his Subjects to the obedience of the faith if Chriſt, and to the profeſſion of it. But this is not unfitting nor improper, That a Magiſtrate ſhould draw his ſword, though not in matters ſpirituall, yet about matters ſpiritual to protect them in peace, and to ſtave off the diſturbers, and deſtroyers of them. It were improper and unfitting, for carpenters to bring their Axes and Hammers to build up the ſpirituall Kingdome and Church of Chriſt: But yet their tooles are fitting to build up ſcaffolds, that the people may draw neere to heare the Word, &amp; by hearing, be brought on to faith and ſalvation.</p>

               <p>This is a meere pretence in the mouth &amp; pen of the Diſcuſſer: For he having cut off all the Churches of Chriſt, and all Church Ordinances, and Church-weapons from off the face of the earth for theſe many ages paſt, and I know not for how many yeares yet to come: If Civill weapons be debarred from defending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, upon pretence, that Church-weapons are ſufficient, and and then no Churches nor Church weapons to be found upon the face of the earth, then let all Seducers to Apoſtacy, Idolaters, &amp; Hereticks, let them all rejoyce in an open doote of liberty, &amp; ſafety, which the Diſcuſſer hath ſet wide open before them. If Civill States muſt not, and Churches cannot, come in to helpe the Lord, ſhall the curſe of <hi>Meroz</hi> be ſo avoided, becauſe the Lord wanteth not power to help himſelfe?

               <p>And ſo think I too, yet without the leaſt prejudice to the cauſe in hand. For if the Queſtion be of the dutyes which Subjects owe to Magiſtrates, they pertaine to the ſecond Table: or if the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be of the vertu eof love one to another, That it is the fulfilling
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:160232:51"/>of the whole Law, It is meant cheifely of the ſecond Table: though withall it be true, the ſecond Table cannot be fulfilled without ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the firſt Table alſo. Theſe things are out of controverſie. But what is all this to the point in hand? The Apoſtle in calling love the fulfilling of the Law, ſpeaketh of the Law of the ſecond Table. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Magiſtrate (who is ſpoken of in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) hath no power to puniſh the crimes againſt the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? or thus further, in the 13. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Duties of Subjects to Magiſtrates (which is a Duty of the ſecond Table:) therefore Magiſtrates have no power to puniſh their Subjects for crimes againſt the firſt Table?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> might as well argue, that the duties of Subjects to Magiſtrates, are duties of the ſecond Table: therefore it is not the Dutie of Subjects to pray for their Magiſtrates, which is a Duty of the firſt Table? The Truth is, though Prayer be a Duty of the firſt Table; yet to pray for Magiſtrates, is a Duty of the ſecond Table. In like ſort, though Idolatry, and Blaſphemy, and Hereſie be ſinnes againſt the firſt Table: yet to puniſh theſe with civill penalties is a Duty of the ſecond Table. For let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the feare of God, are not all Duties of Righteouſneſſe to man commanded in the ſecond Table, as well as all Duties of Holineſſe to God, commanded in the firſt Table? If ſo, I demand againe, whether it be not a Duty of Righteouſneſſe belonging to the people of God, to enjoy the free paſſage of Religion, Truth of Doctrine, Holineſſe of worſhip, Purity of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I demand yet further, if it be not an injurious dealing to the people of God, to diſturb the Truth of Doctrine with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? the holineſſe of worſhip with Idolatry? the Purity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with Tyranny? If all theſe be granted, then it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably followeth, that all theſe wayes of unrighteouſneſſe are juſtly puniſhable by the ſecond Table. Let not therefore the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer</hi> pleaſe himſelfe in deluding himſelfe, and the world, that <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Calvine</hi> did abſolutely denie the 13. of the <hi>Romans</hi> to concerne any matter of the firſt Table. For though the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Loyalty to Magiſtrates, and of love to all, concerne the ſecond Table, yet it was neither the word nor Judgement of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> ſo to interpret <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.

                  <hi>THe higher powers in this</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>were (amongſt others) the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, and ſubordinate Magiſtrates under them.

                  <hi>Now then I argue, If</hi> Paul <hi>had commanded this ſubjection to</hi> Romane <hi>Magiſtrates in ſpirituall cauſes to defend the Truth, to puniſh Hereticks, (neither of which they could diſcerne nor judge of, but by Truſt from others, as</hi> Pilate <hi>condemned Jeſus) he muſt in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men, have put out the eye of Faith, and Reaſon, and ſenſe at once.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Not in the Judgement of all men, for beſides <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> (whoſe Judgement you have heard) all thoſe Interpreters, who
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:160232:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>expound this place in the <hi>Romans,</hi> of the Magiſtrates power in puniſhing ſpirituall evill doers, as well as corporall, they, none of them doe ſo judge, that <hi>Paul</hi> in commanding the Churches to yeild ſubjection unto civill Magiſtrates in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did put out the Eye of Faith, and Reaſon, and ſenſe at once.</p>
               <p>For firſt, it is one thing to yeild ſubjection to the unrighteous Decrees of Ignorant, and Pagan Magiſtrates: another thing to obey their Ordinances in matters of Faith, and worſhip, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church. The former of theſe, Chriſtians did yeild unto the Romane Magiſtrates, even ſubjection unto the Death: the other, they neither did, nor ought to yeild: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God was to be obeyed rather then men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though it be true, whilſt the Romane Emperours and Magiſtrates were Pagans and Perſecutors, they were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, to diſcerne and give Sentence in the ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſtian Religion: yet the word of Chriſt, who commandeth a Duty, commandeth all the neceſſary meanes, which tend to that Duty. And therefore in giving them a Power and charge to execute vengeance on evill doers, (and that in matters of ſpirituall unrighteouſneſſe againſt the Church, as in matters of Civill unrighteouſneſſe againſt the Common-wealth) It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved them to enquire and liſten after true Religion, to heare and trie all, and upon ſerious, deliberate, and juſt ſcruting to hold faſt that which is good, and ſo prevent the diſturbance thereof by the contrary. It was no vaine charge of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, 10, 11, 12. If Chriſt have an Iron Scepter in his hand (to cruſh all States, and Kingdomes, Emperours, and Princes, as well as private perſons) <hi>Be wiſe now therefore ô yee Kings: be inſtructed yee that are Judges of the Earth, ſerve the Lord with feare, rejoyce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with trembling. Kiſſe the Sonne leaſt he be angry, and yee periſh in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the caſes of Religion, wherein we allow Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to be Judges, are ſo fundamentall, and palpable, that no Magiſtrate ſtudious of Religion in the feare of God, but, if he have any ſpirituall diſcerning (as all truly Chriſtian Magiſtrates have, and even Pagans have diſcerned between innocent Chriſtians, and turbulent Seducers) he cannot but judge of ſuch groſſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:160232:53"/>as are unſufferable in Religion, as hath been opened above. Though we reſerve to the Prophets and Churches <hi>Judicium Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticum,</hi> as hath been ſaid above: yet we allow <hi>Judicium Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> to Civill Magiſtrates ſtudious of Truth (as all ought to be) and the Judgement of Diſcretion unto all Chriſtians. But as for ſuch Magigiſtrates as are meerely naturall and Pagan, though Chriſtians be bound to ſubject themſelves unto them with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: yet ſuch Magiſtrates ought to forbeare the exerciſe of their Power, either in protecting, or puniſhing matters of Religion, till they have learned ſo much knowledge of the Truth, as may enable them to diſcerne of things that differ.</p>
               <p>But this forbearance of theirs is not for want of Authority in their callings, nor for want of Duty in their Conſciences, but for want of evidence to them in the cauſe. In which Caſe, Magiſtrates are wont to forbeare their exerciſe of their Power, and to reſpit Judgement even in Civill cauſes, not for want of Authority, or Duty, to doe Juſtice: But for want of ripe and full cognizance of the Cauſe.</p>

               <p>This appeale of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Caeſar</hi> doth evidently hold forth three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a lawfull and needfull uſe of civill Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>All theſe ſinnes might with ſome colour have been charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to Judge, whether his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Miniſtery, or Miniſtration were of God, or no.

               <p>HAving diſpatched two Arguments (againſt the founding of the civill Magiſtrates power in ſpirituall cauſes, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Firſt, from the Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza:</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Caeſars</hi> incompetency and inſufficiency to Judge of ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.)</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:160232:54"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>I come now to the third Argument, taken from the nature of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates weapons: he hath a Sword, and that Sword is a civill Sword, a Sword of civill Juſtice which being of a materiall and civill nature, ſerveth for the defence of Perſons, Eſtates, Families, Liberties of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or civill State, and for the ſuppreſſing of uncivill and injurious Perſons, or Actions by civill puniſhment. And therefore this Sword can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend now (as it did in</hi> Iſrael <hi>of old) to ſpirituall and ſoule cauſes, to ſpirituall and ſoule puniſhments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>I eaſily hold with the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> that the civill Sword doth not extend to ſpirituall and ſoule puniſhments. But if the civill Sword ought to extend to the defence of civill men in civill Liberties, then why not alſo to the like defence of Churches, and ſpirituall perſons in their ſpirituall Liberties? It is the Office of the civill Magiſtrate to governe his people in righteouſneſſe. And if ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Liberties be in righteouſneſſe due to ſpirituall perſons, as well as civill Liberties to civill perſons, doubtleſſe the Magiſtrate is defective in Rules of righteouſneſſe, if he onely attend the defence of the civill people, in their civill Rights, and neglect to defend his ſpirituall people in their ſpirituall Rights.</p>
               <p>What though the Sword be of a materiall and civill nature? ſo it was in the Old Teſtament, as well as in the new. It can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reach no further, either then or now, then unto the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, in bodily life, or civill Liberties: But it can reach to puniſh in theſe things not onely the offenders in bodily Life, and civill Liberties, but alſo the offendors againſt ſpirituall Life and ſoule Liberties.</p>
               <p>What though it be called a civill Sword in common ſpeech? It is not a Scripture-phraſe, ſo to call it: It may as fitly be called the Sword of God, as well as the Sword of warre is ſo called <hi>(Judges</hi> 7.20.) which the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> (guilefully, or elſe unskilfully) diſtinguiſheth in this chapter from the civill Sword. Now if the Sword of the Judge, or Magiſtrate, be the Sword of the Lord, why may it not be drawne forth, as well to defend his Subjects in true Religion, as in civill Peace?</p>
               <p>And as Magiſtrates are called (in common ſpeech) civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: ſo are they called alſo in the Language of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary) Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If civill Magiſtrates are to attend to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:160232:54"/>civill matters: are not Gods to attend to Gods matters? It was wont to goe for a good Argument <hi>â conjugatis, homo ſum, humani nihil â me alienum puto.</hi> But now (by the <hi>Diſcuſſers</hi> Doctrine) the Magiſtrate may ſay, <hi>Ego (dignatione Divinâ) Deus ſum</hi> (Pſal. 82.) <hi>quatenus autem Deus ſum; Divina omnia â me aliena puto.</hi> Now farre be all ſuch reaſonleſſe, and Paganiſh, yea worſe then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh, Atheology from us. Worſe then Paganiſh I ſay, for Pagan Princes accounted their Religion their chiefe care, <hi>prima cura ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum.</hi> And can a Chriſtian forbid the care of Religion to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, I ſay not, without bluſhing, but without trembling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Magiſtrates were called Gods in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>not ſo in the New. Now under Chriſt all Nations are meerely Civill, without any ſuch Typicall holy reſpect upon them as was upon</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Nationall Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is written in the New Teſtament, the Kingdomes of the world are become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. And if the Kingdomes be Gods Kingdomes, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Chriſt, then the Kings of thoſe Kingdomes, are Gods Kings, and Chriſtian Kings and what Title is there in all the New Teſtament that either derogateth from the Titles, or Office of Kings?</p>
               <p>Though the Nations now have not that Typicall holineſſe, which the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had: yet all the Churches of the Saints, have as much Truth and reality of holineſſe, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had.

               <p>A <hi>Fourth Argument from this Scripture</hi> (Rom. 13.) <hi>I take (in</hi> ver. 6.) <hi>which is a meerely civill reward for the Magiſtrates worke.

               <p>The Contributions of the Saints and Churches, are truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle carnall things, <hi>Romans</hi> 15.27. and againe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. But ſhall a man therefore thus reaſon, as the wages be, ſuch is the worke: But the wages are carnall things: therefore ſuch is the worke of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to whom ſuch wages are paid? It is true the contributions of the Saints, may be called Holy, becauſe they are given to God, and (by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to the maintenance of ſuch as miniſter in his houſe about his holy things: But theſe are mentall relations, no reall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferances in the thigns given to Magiſtrates, and Miniſters: The wages given to them both, are carnall things. And conſider them both in their proper ends: as the rewards given to Miniſters, are given for their ſervice about holy things: ſo the rewards given to Magiſtrates are given for their ſervice about righteous things. Now if the Purity of Doctrine, worſhip, and Government be righteous priviledges of all the Churches in the Common-wealth, ſurely Magiſtrates doe not well deſerve all their wages, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Churches to be bereaved, and diſpoyled of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priviledges, which is the greateſt and beſt part of their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Apoſtle commandeth the Churches, and Saints not onely to pay to Magiſtrates, Tribute, and Cuſtome, (which are civill things:) but alſo to poure out all manner of Prayers, and Supplications, Interceſſions, and given of thanks for them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1, 2. And ſurely theſe are ſpirituall dues, and not Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore Magiſtrates owe to the Churches, and Saints ſome Spirituall recompences, which the Apoſtle alſo there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that we may live a quiet and peaceable Life in all godlineſſe and honeſty, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. If therefore the Churches and Saints be not ſuffered to live a quiet and peaceable Life in. Godlineſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: or if they be ſuffered to live a quiet and peaceable life in ungodlineſſe and diſhoneſty, the Magiſtrates fall ſhort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſpirituall recompence for the ſpirituall Duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices performed for them.</p>

                  <hi>Laſtly, that the Spirit of God never intended to direct or warrant the Magiſtrate, to uſe his power in ſpirituall affaires and Religions, I

               <p>One would thinke the Argument would rather evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

               <p>If Magiſtrates be the Miniſters of God (as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them) then their Miniſtery or office is not meerely humane, but as the Apoſtle ſaith, it is of God, and ordained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. And if it be of God, it muſt alſo be for God: or elſe he is a Miniſter and ſervant not of God, but of the world. It is true, men agree to conſtitute it, to wit, this or that forme of it (in reſpect of which influence of men, it is called an humane Creation:) but the Truth is, Government it ſelfe is of God, and ordained by God, and every lawfull forme of Government (whether Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Ariſtarchy, or Democracy, or ſome mixt of theſe, according to the State of the People) they are all of God, and ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and authorized by God in his word, and though they be as true and lawfull in thoſe Nations that never heard of the true God, or of his holy Sonne Jeſus: yet it was from the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and appointment of God in the very light of Nature, that ſuch Nations did erect ſuch and ſuch Governments, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the good of humane ſociety, and that not onely in worldly matters, But in matters alſo of Religion.</p>

For he is not ignorant, that I gave two Anſwers, (or Replyes as he calleth them) before, in the ſame place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, when Chriſt commandeth his Diſciples to bleſſe them that curſe them, and perſecute them, he giveth not therein a Rule to publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whether in Church, or Common-wealth, to ſuffer notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, either in Life or Doctrine, to paſſe away with a Bleſſing: but to private Chriſtians, to ſuffer perſecution patiently, yea and to pray for their Perſecutors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe, it is true, Chriſt would have his Diſciples to be farre from perſecuting, (for perſecution is a wicked oppreſſion of men for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake:) but that hindereth not, but that he would have them execute upon all Diſobedience, the Judgement and vengeance required in the Word,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6. Rom. 13.4.</p>
               <p>Both theſe Anſwers the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> paſſeth over in ſilence. For looke, as Children where they cannot read, thinke it beſt to skip
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:160232:58"/>over: ſo men of riper yeares, when they are loath to ſtoop to the Authority of the Truth, they thinke it beſt to paſſe it over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But what is it, the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> is pleaſed to anſwer to?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In this Propoſition, [that it is evill to tolerate notorious evill doers, ſeducing Teachers, ſcandalous livers:] I obſerve two evills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that this Propoſition is too large and generall, becauſe the Rule admitteth of exception, and that according to the will of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>And to prove that this generall Propoſition admitteth ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſpendeth the reſt of this 53. chapter: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the 54<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> chapter, and 55<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I would not ſpend time, nor weary the Reader with following the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> in impertinent, and copious digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I returne briefly this Reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is wholly impertinent, whatſoever the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſcourſe of Gods permiſſion, or toleration of any evill.</p>
               <p>For firſt, God is his owne Rule, and what he doth is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth it. Not his Act, but his word, is a Rule to us. He may tolerate <hi>Cain,</hi> a Murtherer to live; but that is no precedent to a Civill Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I willingly grant, it may be lawfull for a Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to tolerate notorious evill doers in two caſes, under which, all the Examples will fall, which the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> alleadgeth in any word of Truth.</p>
               <p>As firſt, in regard of the efficient cauſe of puniſhing; when the Magiſtrates hand is too weake and feeble, and the offendors Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents ſo great and ſtrong, that Juſtice cannot be done upon him, without manifeſt perill to the whole State, there the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may tolerate a notorious evill, even murther it ſelfe, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> upon this ground did tolerate in <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> the murther of <hi>Abner.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.39.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, in regard of the finall cauſe, an evill may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated to prevent other greater evills: As <hi>Moſes</hi> tolerated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce of unpleaſing Wives, to prevent the murder, or other hard and cruell uſage of them.</p>
               <p>In either of theſe caſes, I would not deny but a murderer may be tolerated: if either the Magiſtrate want ſufficient Power, with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:160232:58"/>ſafety of the State, to cut him off: or if a forraine State be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and addicted to the Murderer, that in caſe the Magiſtrate here cut off him, they will cut off ſundry of our innocent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary members, whom they have gotten into their cuſtody in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of him.</p>
               <p>And if either of theſe be the caſe, I eaſily grant that it is not evill to tolerate a notorious ſeducing falſe Teacher, or other ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous liver: But ſuch an extraordinary doth not hinder the due largeneſſe, and generality of the Propoſition, that it is evill to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate ſeditious evill doers, ſeducing Teachers, ſcandalous Livers. As in a paralell caſe, this Propoſition is not too large, nor too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, it is evill to tolerate a bloudy murderer: notwithſtanding in ſome caſes (ſuch as have been named, but thoſe are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) it may be lawfull to tolerate him.</p>
               <p>Now that in ordinary caſes, it is not lawfull to tolerate a ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing falſe Teacher, the Commandement of God is cleare, and ſtrong, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8, 9. <hi>Thine eye ſhall not pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare him, neither ſhalt thou conceale him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſhall except, that ſtrict Commandement was in force in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe their Land was typically holy, or their Magiſtrates were Types of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Reply is plaine and juſt, God himſelfe alledgeth no ſuch reaſon of his Law: But another quite different, but common with them to all Nations, profeſſing the worſhip of the true God, <hi>Thou ſhalt put him to death, becauſe he ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <p>Neither can any inſtance be given of any Capitall Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but is of Morall, (that is of generall, and perpetuall) Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in all Nations, in all Ages, <hi>Capitalia</hi> Moſis <hi>Politica ſunt aeterna.</hi>

               <p>I <hi>Come now to the ſecond Evill, which I obſerve in the Anſwerers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poſition, that it would be evill to tolerate ſeducing Teachers, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Livers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In two things, I ſhall diſcover the great evill of this joyning and coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:160232:59"/>ſeducing Teachers, and ſcandalous Livers, as the proper and adaequate object of the Magiſtrates care and worke to ſuppreſſe and puniſh.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I no where make it the proper and adaequate object of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates care and worke, to ſuppreſſe, and puniſh ſeducing Teachers, and ſcandalous livers. For I have expreſly ſaid it, and proved it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is, and ought to be the care and worke of the Church alſo to ſuppreſſe and puniſh ſeducing Teachers, and ſcandalous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in a Church-way, as well as the Magiſtrate, in a civill way.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Diſcuſſer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, this joyning of things of ſuch different kindes, is not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall, but heterogeneall commixture of things moſt different in kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe different kinds, they agree in one common kind: they are both of them evills, and evills deſtructive in their ſeverall wayes to the common good of Gods people, which ought to be preſerved both in Church and Common-wealth. The Termes of <hi>Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> and <hi>Heterogeneall,</hi> are in this caſe only words of noyſe, and of an empty ſound, fit to take with ſimple people, that know not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor uſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Diſcuſſer.</label>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who knoweth not, that many ſeducing Teachers of the Paganiſh, Jewiſh, Turkiſh, or Antichriſtian Religion, may be cleare and free from ſcandalous offences in their lives, and from diſobedience to the civill Lawes of the State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Now you may ſee the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> was willing to make uſe of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding words, which himſelfe (it ſeemeth) knew not well the uſe of. For what if there were many ſeducing Teachers of all Religions, that may be cleare from ſcandalous offences? the diſtinguiſhing therefore of evills into theſe two ſorts, into ſeditious Teachers, and ſcandalous offenders, is ſo much the more allowable, and accurate. If a man ſhall ſay the worke of the Creation on the ſixt day, was either of man, or of Beaſt: ſhall a <hi>man goe about here to obſerve a great evill, that here is not an homogeneall, but an heterogeneall commixture of things moſt different in kind? For who knoweth not that there are many Beaſts, Lyons, Leopards, Wolves, Beares, that never were men, but are cleare and free from all humane nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a like reaſoning is that of the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> here. What if many
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:160232:59"/>ſeducing Teachers, whether <hi>Jewiſh, Paganiſh, Turkiſh, Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> were never ſcandalous livers, but obedient to the civill State? yet are they not all of them evill? and accordingly to be reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by lawfull Authority? And is the joyning of them together the great evill of an <hi>heterogeneall</hi> commixture?</p>
               <p>Againe, let the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> be pleaſed to obſerve (that which hath been often touched afore) that we looke at it, as more tolerable, for ſeducing Teachers to ſeduce thoſe who are already in the ſame gall of bitterneſſe with themſelves, as <hi>Pagans</hi> to ſeduce <hi>Pagans, Jewes</hi> to ſeduce <hi>Jewes,</hi> Turkes to ſeduce Turkes, and <hi>Antichriſtians</hi> to ſeduce <hi>Antichriſtians.</hi> Though this alſo ought to be prevented by wiſe and wholſome meanes, by a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in all thoſe that are under his dominion, ſo far as there is power in his hand, without the hazard of the publick State.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let me adde this <hi>Reply</hi> to the reſt, that it will be hard for the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> to finde <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> ſeducers cleare and free from Diſobedience to the civill Lawes of a State, in caſe that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (to whom they are ſworne) ſhall excommunicate the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and preſcribe the civill State to the invaſion of Forrayners.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Again, who knoweth, not that a ſeducing Teacher properly ſinneth againſt the Church, &amp; againſt the Spirituall State and Lawes of it? and therefore ought moſt properly and onely to be dealt withall in ſuch a way.</hi>

For what if a ſeducing Teacher having ſinned againſt the Church, be caſt out by the Church, and ſtill continue ſeducing? yea what a weake and guilfull evaſion, would this prove for the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> to referre a ſeducing Teacher to a Church-way, when himſelfe doth not acknowledge any Church of Chriſt extant upon the face of the Earth?</p>

                  <hi>A ſecond evill, which I obſerve in coupling ſeducing Teachers with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous livers, is a ſilent and implicit Juſtification of all unrighte us and cruell proceedings of</hi> Jewes, <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>againſt all the Prophets of God, the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, and all his meſſingers and witneſſes, whom their Accuſers, have ever ſo coupled and mixed with notorious evill doers, and ſcandalous livers, &amp;c.</hi>

What if the wicked <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did injuriouſly and blaſphemouſly put thoſe names upon the Lord Jeſus, and his faithfull witneſſes, and upon pretence of ſuch evils put them to death? doth it therefore juſtifie ſuch proceedings, to ſay, that ſeducing Teachers, and ſcandalous livers are to be puniſhed by Authority? If thoſe who are indeed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Teachers, and ſcandalous livers ought to be puniſhed, will it therefore juſtifie the like proceedings againſt them who are no ſuch perſons, but falſly ſo called? if a man ſhould ſay, a murderer is to be puniſhed with death, will it therefore juſtifie the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita,</hi> to put <hi>Paul</hi> to death, becauſe amongſt them he was ſo reputed, doubtleſſe a murderer? <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. yea let the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider, whether this kind of reaſoning of his, doe not more then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and implicitely teſtifie, that the Lord Jeſus and his witneſſes, were ſeducing Teachers and ſcandalous livers.</p>

               <p>It was no part of my meaning, to alledge thoſe Scriptures, to prove it unlawfull for Magiſtrates to tolerate ſeducing Teachers, but unlawfull for Churches.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſay there needed no proofe of that, that was out of Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I may truly tell him, that was more then I knew. For the Letter which he intreated me to Anſwer) ſo ſtated the Queſtion, as in generall to argue againſt perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience. And if the Queſtion be put in ſuch generall Termes, I knew the Church might as well be complained of for perſecution for cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as the civill Magiſtrate. For if perſecution be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for affliction or oppreſſion for righteouſneſſe ſake I knew it was out of Queſtion, all perſecution was unlawfull, whether by the Church, or the Magiſtrate: an unjuſt excommunication is as true perſecution, as an unjuſt Baniſhment. But if perſecution be taken more largely, and looſely, (as it is by the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> for any affliction, or perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience (whether good Conſcience, or evill, whether rightly informed, or erroneous) If that be the intent of the Letter (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me) to beare witneſſe againſt that, then any teſtimony of Scripture, that juſtifieth a lawfull cenſure of falſe and erroneous Teachers, doth evince the ſcope of the Letter to be erroneous, which is againſt all perſecution for cauſe of Conſcience. Let therefore the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> admire at his owne admiration, and be aſtoniſhed at his owne aſtoniſhment, that wondereth to ſee an univerſall negative argued againſt by a particular affirmative.</p>
               <p>The Letter denyeth the lawfulneſſe of all perſecution in cauſe of Conſcience, that is, in matter of Religion: I ſeek to evince the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it, by an inſtance of lawfull Church-proſecution in caſe of falſe Teachers.</p>

               <p>The power of the Churches and Angels, of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyra,</hi> were ſufficient for thoſe ends, for which Chriſt ordained

In which place, It was not the intent of the Holy Ghoſt, (nor mine) to threaten the Church with a red of Correction: But to comfort the Church with a double bleſſing: Firſt of the Fatherly proviſion and protection of Princes for the Church: Secondly, of their ſubjection to the Church, in reſpect of their ſpirituall Eſtate. What Princes may doe, in caſe the Church ſhould Apoſtate, and become no Church: or in caſe they ſhould breake forth into Sedition, and Rebellion againſt the Civill State, It is another Queſtion which I have not medled with, in all this Diſcourſe. Neither have I ſpoken of Princes, as bound to Judge, what is true feeding, or correcting: leaſt of all have I ſaid, that all men are bound (eſpecially in Conſcience) to their feeding, and correcting. Theſe are calumnies deviſed by the <hi>Diſcuſſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All I have ſaid (to my remembrance) this way, is, that Princes are bound to be wiſe, and Learned with holy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they may kiſſe the Sonne, and be ſubject to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10.11. And therefore able to diſcerne of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt feeding, as deſtroyeth the Foundation of Religion, and the ſoules of Gods people, that they may be able to reſtraine ſuch, and to preſerve the Church from ſuch ravenous Wolves: and I deny not that their Subjects are to ſubmit to them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; when they judge according to the Word; or howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver patiently to ſuffer for well-doing, without reſiſtance, in a way of Hoſtility, notwithſtanding any Church-power. If ought be unſound in this dealing with Princes, I am willing to heare of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Another while, when Princes croſſe Mr.</hi> Cottons <hi>Judgement, and Practiſe, then it matters not, what the Profeſſion and Practiſe of Princes is: for,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their Profeſſion and Practiſe is no Rule to Conſcience.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If Princes ſwerve from the rule of the word, either in profeſſion, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:160232:62"/>practiſe, their owne profeſſion, or practiſe is no rule either to themſelves, or others. Princes ought not to rule the word, but are to be ruled by it. But ſee the notorious calumny, of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer, ſo repreſenting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cottons</hi> dealing with Princes, as if he made his owne judgement and practiſe the rule of the proceeding of Princes.

Since the Diſcuſſer concludeth, it will evidently follow, that wee will ſubmit to no Magiſtrates, but juſt of our owne Conſciences let him make that evident, which he ſaith, is evident, or elſe, let him ſay, he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently miſtaken, <hi>né quid dicam gravius.</hi>

To allow them power over our ſelves in caſe of Hereticall Delinquency, is not to make them ſtaires, or ſtirrops of our advancement, but Swords, and ſtaves (if need be) for our puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I wonder what fancy came into the Diſcuſſers minde, to dreame of rich and honorable Seates, and Saddels of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates?

                  <hi>IN the ſecond place, the Anſwerer ſaith, that Princes out of State-Policy, doe ſometime Tolerate, what ſuiteth not with Chriſtianity: and out of State-neceſſity Tolerate</hi> (<hi>as</hi> David <hi>did</hi> Joab) <hi>againſt their wills.</hi>

                  <hi>But then the Anſwerer muſt acknowledge with me, That there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:160232:63"/>is a neceſſity ſometime of State-Toleration, as in the caſe of</hi> Joab. <hi>And ſo his former affirmation, generally lay'd downe,</hi> [viz, <hi>That it is evill to Tolerate ſeducing Teachers, and Scandalous Lives.</hi>] <hi>Was not duely weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and is too light.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I eaſily acknowledge ſometime a neceſſity of State Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As I have formerly expreſſed (in Chap. 53.) eſpecially in two caſes, whereof that of <hi>Joab</hi> is one.</p>
               <p>But that will nothing impeach the Truth of my former affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation delivered in generall termes, eſpecially, if it be weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary. For the holy writings of the Sanctuary doe expreſly deliver the like poſition, in like generall termes. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, who ſo ſheddeth mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed. This Law is delivered in generall termes: and yet though <hi>Joab</hi> was a murderer, he was tolerated to live all the Reigne of <hi>David:</hi> yet I hope the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> wil not ſay, that generall Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and is too light.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I affirme Secondly, That that State-Policy, and State-neceſſity which permitteth Conſciences of men, will be found to agree moſt punctually with the Rules of the beſt Politition, that ever the world ſaw, the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, who commanded the permitting of the Tares, to wit, Antichriſtians, or falſe Chriſtians with true Chriſtians, as I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed above.</hi>

               <p>That diſcourſe hath bin examined above, and found too light, ſo farre as it croſſeth the Truth returned in Anſwer to the Letter. To permit ſome Antichriſtians, or falſe Chriſtians, The Anſwer to the Letter did allow: unleſſe they maintained Fundamentall Hereſies againſt the Foundation of Religion, and that obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after conviction, and did withall ſeduce others, into the ſame Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>But as for ſuch Hereticks, and ſeducing Teachers, I hope, it hath been cleared, they are none of thoſe Tares, of which Chriſt ſaith, Let them alone.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is an Interpretation of Chriſts words formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not to be reverſed, That if by Tares were meant, ſuch
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:160232:64"/>groſſe offendors, then the ſpeech of Chriſt.

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame</hi> Conſtantine <hi>made a ſevere Law, againſt the</hi> Donatiſts: <hi>&amp; the like proceedings againſt them were uſed by</hi> Valentinian, Gratian, <hi>&amp;</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>as</hi> Auguſtine <hi>reporteth in</hi> Epiſt. 166. <hi>onely</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate graunted liberty to Hereticks as well as to Pagans, that he might by Tolerating all weeds to grow, choake the vitalls of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: Which was alſo the practiſe and ſinne of</hi> Ualens <hi>the</hi> Arian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queene</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>as famous for her government, as moſt of the former, It is well knowne what Lawes ſhe made, and executed againſt Papiſts: Yea and King</hi> James <hi>(one of your owne Witneſſes) though he was ſlow in proceeding againſt Papiſts (as you ſay) for Conſcience ſake; yet you are not ignorant, how ſharply and ſeverely he puniſhed thoſe, whom the Malignant world calleth Puritans, men of more Conſcience &amp; better Faith, then the Papiſts, whom he Tolerated.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt, for mine owne part, I would not uſe an Argument from the number of Princes, witneſſing in profeſſion, or practiſe, againſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <hi>Secondly, I obſerve, how inconſiderately (I hope not willingly) the Anſwerer paſſeth by the reaſons and grounds, urged by theſe three Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In King</hi> James <hi>his ſpeech, he paſſeth by that golden Maxime, that God never loved to plant his Church by bloud.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Diſcuſſer is miſtaken, when he ſaith I paſſed over their reaſons and grounds inconſiderately, though he hopeth, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: for indeed I paſſed them over willingly, but not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately. For I well conſidered, either the reaſons wanted weight, or elſe did not impugne the cauſe in hand. For inſtance, this ſpeech of King <hi>James</hi> (That God never loved to plant his Church by bloud) though it be a Truth of weight: yet it doth not touch this cauſe. It is farre from us, to defend the planting of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:160232:65"/>Churches by bloud: that is, to compell men to yeeld themſelves to the fellowſhip of the Church by bloudy Lawes, or poenalties: the Church of Chriſt admitteth no members, but a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That civill obedience may be performed by Papiſts: this was another reaſon of King</hi> James <hi>paſſed over by the Anſwerer.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>No marvell, that I paſſed it over: for I did not finde it in the Letter. For though the King ſay (as the Letter reporteth him, I onely declared, to be ſecured for civill obedience: which for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauſe, they were bound to performe:) yet the King do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſay, That civill obedience may be performed, by Papiſts, ſtanding ſtedfaſt to the rules of their owne Religion.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, The Kings third ground is his obſervation in</hi> Revel. 20. <hi>That perſecution is a true &amp; certaine note of a falſe Church: The wicked are Beſeigers, the faithfull Beſeiged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>I ſubſcribe to the King that perſecution (properly ſo called, that is, the oppreſſion of any for righteouſneſſe ſake) is a note of a falſe Church: but nor a certaine note. For againe, I ſay, that perſecution properly ſo called, may be ſometime found, in the true Church. For which of all the Prophets did not the Church of the old Teſtament perſecute? <hi>Acts</hi> 7.52.</p>
               <p>And yet that perſecution was not the true and certaine note of a falſe Church: For then God had left no true Church upon the face of the earth. But this I graunt, That ſuch perſecution, where ever it is found, It is a degree of falſhood and A poſtacy in that Church. But what a vaſt diſtance is there between the juſt cenſure
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:160232:65"/>of Apoſtaſticall, and Hereticall ſeducers, and diſturbers of the Churches peace and truth, and between perſecution?</p>
               <p>As for the other ſpeech [The wicked are beſeigers, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are beſeiged] It may well be ſaid of the ſeige ſpoken of in that 20. of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> But if it ſhould be put for a univerſall Maxime, Royall Authority cannot make it good Divinity. When the ten Chriſtian Kings ſhall hate the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16.) I ſuppoſe the Diſcuſſer will not ſay, the wicked are Beſeigers, the faithfull are beſeiged.</p>

                  <hi>In King Stephens ſpeech of</hi> Poland, <hi>he paſſeth by the true difference, between a civill, and a ſpirituall Government. I am</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Stephen) <hi>a civill Magiſtrate over the bodyes of men, not a ſpirituall over their ſoules.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Stephens</hi> ſpeech may well ſtand, and the cauſe ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. The Magiſtrate is a Ruler over the Bodies of men, not over their ſoules: He cannot command their ſoules, nor binde their Conſciences, nor puniſh their ſpirits. It is the Lord alone can reach them. That which the King or Magiſtrate can doe, or doeth in this caſe, is to puniſh the bodyes of men for deſtroying, or diſturbing Religion.</p>

               <p>It is Babel indeed, for civill Magiſtrates, to make Lawes to binde Conſcience, and to excommunicate tranſgreſſors of thoſe Lawes: But to puniſh falſe Prophets, and Seducers of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Idolatry, was never the practiſe of Babel: but it was, and is their practiſe, not onely to Tolerate them, but to advance, and encourage them.</p>
               <p>If it were a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſeeking of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a bringing him from his Grave, to puniſh Seducers for Idolatry, then after <hi>Moſes</hi> was buried, that Law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.) was abrogated. But his buryall, and Gods hiding of the place thereof, was rather a confirmation, and eſtabliſhment of it, then any Abrogation, or Impeachment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:160232:66"/>of it. For may it not juſtly be conceived. That the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hid the place of his buriall, leaſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, might goe a whoring after his Sepulchre, and it may be offer ſweet incenſe upon it: and ſo ſuch falſe worſhip againſt the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> might come to be Tolerated, for honor to the body of <hi>Moſes?</hi>

               <p>Though Chriſt aboliſhed a Nationall Church-State, and inſtead thereof ſet up a Congregationall Church: yet Chriſt never aboliſhed, a Nationall Civill State, nor the Judiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were of Morall equity, but eſtabliſhed them rather, in their place and order. He that ſhed his own bloud to plant his Church, did never aboliſh that Law, which enacted, that his bloud ſhould be upon him, who ſhould ſupplant his Church. If Chriſts bloud goe to plant it, let the falſe Chriſts bloud goe for ſupplanting it.</p>

               <p>And the perſecution, he ſpeaketh of, was not of Antichriſtians, or Hereticks, or Idolaters, but onely of ſuch as the world nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Puritans, or the like, and of them too, without convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the error of their way.</p>

The contrary is evident, <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> by Tolerating and favoring the <hi>Arians,</hi> the whole world became <hi>Arian; Ingemuit orbis Chriſtianus, et miratus eſt factum ſe eſſe Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum.</hi> Now whether be the greater miſcheife the whole world to become <hi>Arian,</hi> or to become Chriſtian, Let Chriſtians judge. The Diſcuſſer indeed ſpeaketh of it, as a ſoliſciſme in Religion, that the whole world ſhould become Chriſtian, and quoteth for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. and 13. But <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. ſpeaketh nothing to the purpoſe: and <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. ſpeaketh of it, as a marveilous evill, that the whole world ſhould wonder after the Beaſt, ver. 3. But their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering after the Beaſt, not a becoming Chriſtian (for they were that before) nor did it ſpring onely from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing zeale of Chriſtian Emperors in perſecuting Apoſtate Hereticks: But rather from their ſinful Indulgence in the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks in Doctrine, and Idolaters in Worſhip. For had they been zealous, and watchfull againſt ſuch, how is it poſſible, that ever Antichriſt ſhould have been hatched up, to carry the world after him into ſuch a notorious Apoſtacy? It was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, that made the world, Chriſtian: but Toleration, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:160232:68"/>made the world, Antichriſtian. Furthermore, the hurt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing zeale of good Emperors did to the Church, came in alſo another way, by advancing Church-Officers to Mountaines of high preferments, and ſettled indowments, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.8, 9. The Church never tooke hurt by the puniſhment of Hereticks. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when God advanced <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and other good Emperors to ſit on the Throne, It is true, the Church ſoone became a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: but that came not to paſſe becauſe thoſe Emperors forced Pagans into Church-Fellowſhip by the materiall Sword (as the Diſcuſſer intimateth, but untruly) But becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort are willing to follow the example of great ones, <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis:</hi> as alſo becauſe of the ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the watchmen (the Elders of the Churches) who ſhould not have ſuffered ſuch ſtore of Tares to come into the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church. Had the world renounced their Paganiſme, and profeſſed Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, but yet had been kept out of the Fellowſhip of the Church, till they had approved their profeſſion by a ſincere Chriſtian converſation. It had been no ſoliſciſme at all (howſoever the Diſcuſſer judge of it) though the whole world had been come—Chriſtian, and ſtiled Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But it is too groſſe and palpable a miſtake, to make this the cauſe why the Garden of the Church, <hi>and the Field of the world became all one, becauſe the zeale of Chriſtian Emperors intending to exalt Chriſt, did not attend to the command of Chriſt, to permit the Tares to grow in the Field of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they did permit them to live in the Field of the world, they ſeldome or never put any to death for Hereticall pravity (though it had bin better they had ſo done with ſome of them:) But onely exiled them from ſuch Cities and Countryes as were moſt Populous, where if they had continued, they might have had too great an opportunity of ſpreading their leaven, which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh fretteth like a Gangrene, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.</p>

For beſide experience, the Text in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.10.11. Declareth, that by the fall of a Starre, (called wromewood) into the waters, the third part of the watters were embittered by it, and many men dyed that drunk of thoſe warters. And what was that Starre, but <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though Beds of eaſe have been one meanes of choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtianity, yet that hindereth not, but the Toleration of all weeds to grow with the good ſeed, is another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when he ſaith, <hi>Their perſecuting of others was a meanes of choaking Chriſtianity:</hi> It is a plaine contradiction of his former ſpeech, <hi>that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>did more hunt to Chriſts Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then the raging fury of the moſt bloudy Neroes.</hi>

               <p>I neither did in termes approve the perſecution of the one, nor reprove the perſecution of the other. The words I ſpake of them are recited above. Chap. 58. which containe an Hiſtoricall Narration of the <hi>Res geſtas</hi> in this caſe of both the Princes, but neither approvement, nor reprovement of them. It was enough to anſwer the Priſoners Argument, that as great Princes as the three named by him for Toleration, might be named againſt Toleration: As Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for one, and King <hi>James</hi> for another, who perſecuted Puritans though he Tolerated Papiſts.</p>

               <p>It followeth not. For Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might doe well in puniſhing ſeditious, or ſeducing Papiſts according to Conſcience rightly informed, and King <hi>James</hi> doe ill according to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence miſinformed. Beſides, It may be the worſe, when a man perſecuteth thoſe, whom he knoweth to be innocent, againſt his own Conſcience. Or ſuppoſe Conſcience by often ſinning againſt the light &amp; cheks of it, be (by the juſt Judgement of God) blinded and ſeared, In ſuch a caſe to doe a wicked act according to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doth not extenuate, but aggravate a ſin: in that ſuch a man ſinneth not only in doing a corrupt act, but (which is worſe) with a corrupt Conſcience. But with what Conſcience King <hi>James</hi> did perſecute Puritans, I judge not: the judgement of ſuch things is with the Lord.</p>

               <p>None of theſe things will follow. For though King <hi>James</hi> did evill to perſecute godly Miniſters, and other good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:160232:70"/>ſtudious of Reformation: yet he was fit to have been a King, and wanted not the eſſentiall Qualifications of a King. For he was by lawfull Succeſſion the next heire of the Crowne, and was beſides endued with many royall guifts of wiſdome, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, both of Scripture and Policy, which if he did not alwayes attend to, in his Adminiſtrations, the defect was not for want of Eſſentiall Qualifications, but for want of employing his Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations according to the right Rule of the word of God. For by the Rule of the word, thoſe (whom they called) Puritans ought not to have been perſecuted, no though they had been erroneous in their way, which they were not. For though they conſented not to the State-Government of the Church; yet neither did they tumultuouſly and ſeditiouſly reſiſt it. But ſuppoſe Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates doe want ſome Qualifications meet for their calling (as this for one, Knowledge and Judgement rightly to diſcerne, who may be puniſhed for matters of Religion, who not:) yet ſuch Qualifications are not of the Eſſence of the calling of a King, or Magiſtrate, but belong onely to the Integrity of it. Yea ſuch Kings or Magiſtrates as want ſuch cleare diſcerning of this point, they have a juſt Call to forbeare all execution of civill Cenſures in matters of Religion, till they be better informed. Or elſe (as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſaith truly) they may perſecute the Sonne of God in ſtead of the ſonne of Perdition.</p>

               <p>Perſecution of Innocents never brought good to Princes, or Subjects, but accidentally: as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſaid above, that <hi>Nero</hi> in perſecuting, made the hearts of <hi>Chriſtians, more ſweet, and fragrant like pounded Spices.</hi> But ſuch evill ought not to have been done, that ſuch good in ſuch a way might come of it.</p>
               <p>But the good that is brought to Princes and Subjects by the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:160232:71"/>due puniſhment of Apoſtate Seducers, and Idolaters, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, is manifold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it putteth away evill from the people, and cutteth off a Gangreene, which would ſpread to further ungodlineſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it driveth away Wolves from worrying, and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sheep of Chriſt.

               <p>Nor can I tell, how it ſtandeth with Truth, that Papiſts in their Warres ever had the Victory: ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ever had the Victory over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Though Papiſts have fought with various Succeſſe, it is Gods manner to nurture his people with ſome croſſes, that they might at length learne to fight not in their owne ſtrength, but in the Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. The ſtory is evident, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> never loſt Battell, but when they complyed with the Papiſts, and truſted more in their falſe pretences, then <hi>in the Lord. Neither is it true, that the finall ſucceſſe ef the Victory fell to the Romiſh Church to the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of thoſe</hi> Waldenſian <hi>witneſſes.</hi>

               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:160232:72"/>
               <p>For it never came to an utter Extirpation of them, but only to a diſperſion into ſundry Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>

               <p>Beſide, to perſecute is not alwayes a marke of a falſe Church: for then it would be a marke of a falſe Member of a Church, or a marke of a Member of a falſe Church: but the contrary appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the example of <hi>Aſa,</hi> who perſecuted the Prophet of God for his holy Meſſage ſake, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10. And it hath been ſhewed above, that <hi>Stephen</hi> complaineth of the perſecution of all the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. And if they were perſecuted, it was by the Church of the Old Teſtament: and if therefore the Church of the Old Teſtament was falſe, God had then no Church extant upon the face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a begging of the Queſtion, to affirme, that thoſe</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Churches cannot be truly Chriſtian, who by themſelves, or by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill power of Kings, doe puniſh ſuch as diſſent from them or are oppoſite againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed a double begging of the Queſtion, it is: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It beggeth that for the Queſtion, which is not the Queſtion: for it is no Queſtion, but out of Queſtion, that it is not lawfull for a Chriſtian Church, to puniſh men for diſſenting from them, or being oppoſite to them. But the Queſtion is, whether Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrates may not puniſh Apoſtate Hereticks and Seducers, not for diſſenting from the Church, but for ſeducing from Chriſt, and blaſpheming againſt his Name. And (if you will) whether the Church may not ſtirre up the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, (after all mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der helps uſed without a vaile) to doe his Duty in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is another begging of the Queſtion, to take that for granted <hi>(which is not yet proved) that it is a marke of no true Chriſtian Church to procure the civill puniſhment of incurable obſtinate Hereticks and Seducers.</hi>

Excommunication being of a ſpirituall nature, a ſentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the word of Chriſt Jeſus (the ſpirituall King of the Chureh:) and a ſpirituall killing by the two edged Sword of the Spirit, in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the perſon Excommunicate unto Satan.

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt ſtill profeſſe my ſelfe to be one of them that ſee it not. For firſt the Author of the Letter did no where expreſſe himſelfe to put any difference, neither between Church and Court, in point of cenſure for cauſe of Conſcience: nor between cauſes of Religion, whether true, or falſe. If it be unlawfull to baniſh any from the Common-wealth for cauſe of Conſcience, it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to baniſh any from the Church for cauſe of Conſcience. The Church ought to be more tender of the Liberty of Conſcience, then the Court, as being more acquainted with the tenderneſſe of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the cenſure of a man for cauſe of Conſcience by the civill Sword, be perſecution, it is a farre greater perſecution to cenſure a man for cauſe of Conſcience, by the Spirituall Sword, by how much the more ſharp and keen the ſpirituall Sword is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the civill. Sure I am, Chriſt Jeſus reckoneth Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for perſecution, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.12. They ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the Synagogues, and into Priſons. To deliver up into Synagogues is as much perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to deliver into Priſons. And will the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> then ſay, that if Chriſt had been awakened from <hi>his ſpirituall ſlumber, and from the Drunkenneſſe of the great Whore, it had been impoſſible, he ſhould have accounted Excommunication a perſecution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Me thinks, if a ſoule were awakened unto ſpirituall ſobriety, he ſhould judge it a ſorer and a deeper affliction, to be bound with ſpirituall chaines, both in Earth and Heaven, then to be bound in materiall chaines on Earth onely.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwered by conceſſion of <hi>Hilaryes</hi> words in <hi>Hilaries meaning, it is true, what</hi> Hilary <hi>ſaith, neither did the Apoſtles, nor may wee propogate Chriſtian Religion by the Sword, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>But a Chriſtian Church doth no more perſecute, then a Lilly doth ſcratch thornes, or a Lamb purſue and teare the Wolves, or a Turtle Dove doth hunt the Hawkes, or Eagles, or a chaſt modeſt virgin fight, and ſcratch like Whores and Harlots.</hi>

               <p>If by perſecution, the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> meaneth (as it ſeemeth he doth) the infliction of the civill puniſhments, his ſpeech is true, and the proportion holdeth, civill puniſhments are as improper for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches to inflict, as for Lillies to ſcratch Thornes, or Lambes to teare Wolves, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if the Lambes he ſpeaketh of in his compariſon, were as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as the Lambes of Chriſt be, though they would not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves purſue and teare the Wolves, yet they would runne to their Shepheards (and civill Magiſtrates are the ſhepheards of all their people) to ſend out their dogs after the Wolves, to purſue and teare them. <hi>I</hi> ſee no reaſon, why the chaſt and modeſt eye of a Chriſtian Church ſhould any more ſpare, and pity a ſpirituall Adulterer, that ſeeketh to withdraw her from her ſpouſe to a falſe Chriſt, then the eye of an Holy <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was to ſpare and pitie the like Tempters in dayes of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8.</p>

                  <hi>That Anſwer to the ſpeech of the Kings implyeth two things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the civill Magiſtrate, who is to conſtraine, muſt judge of all the Conſciences of their Subjects, whether they be convinced or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That when the civill Magiſtrate diſcerneth that his Subjects Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are convinced, then he may conſtraine them</hi> vi &amp; armis, <hi>hoſtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And accordingly, who knoweth not what conſtraint lyeth upon all Conſciences in Old and</hi> New-England, <hi>to come to Church, and to pay Church-Duties? which is upon the point (though with a Sword of a finer gilt and trim in</hi> New-England) <hi>nothing elſe, but that which he confeſſeth,</hi> Hilary <hi>ſaith, ſhould not be done, to wit, a Propagation of Religion by the Sword.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>Neither of both theſe things are implyed in that Anſwer. Not the firſt, (that the civill Magiſtrate muſt then Judge of all of the Conſciences of their Subjects, whether they be convinced, or no:) For it implyeth no more then that he is not to conſtraine them, till he ſee they be convinced. If he never ſee them convinced, he is to ſee, they be never conſtrained. But how far the Magiſtrate may diſcerne, and judge in matters of Religion, hath been ſpoken above. Nor the ſecond: For the conſtraint I ſpake of, was not by poſitive meanes, <hi>vi, &amp; Armis,</hi> but negative, withholding ſuch truſt and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment from ſuch, as he ſeeth are not faithfull and truſty to their God, of whoſe Truth they are convinced, and yet withhold it in unrighteouſneſſe. I know no conſtraint at all, that lieth upon the conſciences of any in <hi>New-England,</hi> to come to Church: neither doe I know that any ſcruple lyeth upon any Conſcience in <hi>New-England,</hi> that withholdeth any from hearing the word amongſt us. But leaſt of all doe I know, that any are conſtrayned to pay Church-duties in <hi>New-Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi> Sure I am, none in our own Town, neither Church-members, nor other, are conſtrained to pay any Church-duties at all.

               <p>It is not true, that the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> doe tolerate the <hi>Indians</hi> (who have ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> protection, and Government) in their worſhip of Devils openly.

What courſes have been uſed to bring them on
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:160232:76"/>to Civility, and to the knowledge of our Religion, by faire meanes, are not pertinent to the preſent controverſie to relate.

The time is haſtning (we hope) when all the vials of Gods wrath will be poured out on the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State: and then we looke for the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to come in, and with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> multitudes of Pagans.

                  <hi>The Anſwerer addeth a further Anſwer to</hi> Tertullian, <hi>for whereas</hi> Tertullian <hi>had ſaid, that one mans Religion doth neither hurt, nor profit another: the Anſwerer ſaith, it muſt be underſtood of private Worſhip, or of Religion profeſſed in private. Otherwiſe a falſe Religion profeſſed in publick, by the Members of the Church, or by ſuch as have given their Names to Chriſt, will be the ruine and Deſolation of the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2.</p>

                  <hi>Whereto I Anſwer,</hi> 1. <hi>Thoſe that are Members of the Church, and thoſe that have given their names to Chriſt, are all one: the diſtinction therefore is unſound.</hi>

For men of yeares muſt give up their names to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be received Members into the Church, as is evident, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56.6, 7.

                  <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſpeech may poſſibly be meant of either publick or private But as I ſaid, to make the ſpeech true, it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be underſtood of private, or if of publick profeſſion of Religion, it muſt be underſtood not of Chriſtian, but of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: and of Pagan during the time of Gods Patience, and their ignorance. But after God revealed the Truth of the Goſpel-Religion to them, it was not ſafe to continue a publick Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pagan-Religion: for after the White-Horſe hath revealed the Goſpel, a Red, and Black, and pale-horſe follow, to avenge
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:160232:77"/>the rejection of it upon the Romane-Pagan-Empire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.2. to 8.</p>

               <p>I anſwer thirdly; although it be true in a Church of <hi>Chriſt, that a falſe Religion, or Worſhip permitted will doe hurt according to thoſe Threats of Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 2. <hi>yet in two caſes, I beleive a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will not hurt (which is moſt like to have been</hi> Tertullians <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A falſe Religion out of the Church will not hurt the Church: no more then weeds in the Wilderneſſe will hurt the incloſed Gardens: nor poyſon hurt the body, when it is not touched, or taken, yea and Antidotes are received againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A falſe Religion and worſhip will not hurt a Civill State, in caſe the worſhippers breake no civill Law. And the Anſwerer elſewhere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that the civill Peace is not broken, where the civill Lawes are not broken. And this onely is the point in Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>If this onely be the point in Queſtion, where then lyeth the controverſie? for if I ſay (as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſaith I doe) that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Peace is not broken, when the Civill Law is not broken; and if a falſe Religion or worſhip doe not hurt the civill State, unleſſe the Worſhippers breake ſome civill Law, then where lyeth the pinch of the controverſie?</p>
               <p>But I would not have the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> miſtake himſelfe; I doe not remember, that I have any where ſaid, that the civill Peace is not broken, where the civill Law is not broken. He ſaith, I ſay ſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: If he meane, that I ſay ſo in the Modell drawn up by my Brethren (the Elders of thoſe Churches) he wrongeth and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe much <hi>(Crimine falſi)</hi> when he ſaith that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> with the reſt of the Miniſters of <hi>New-England</hi> compoſed that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of Church and civill power. It is no new thing with him, to ſay I did that, which I did not: that Modell was drawen up by ſome other fellow-Brethren, but not by me. There is a Truth in the ſpeech which they ſpeak, rightly underſtood, but not as the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> here taketh it.</p>
               <p>For firſt, what if no civill Law be made for the eſtabliſhment of Religion, nor againſt the violation of the Fundamentalls of it? this very defect of ſo needfull a Law, may bring the wrath of God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:160232:77"/>upon the civill State: as did the defect of a King in <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 21.25.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly, there may be a Law made for the eſtabliſhing of true Religion: and it though it be violated, yet the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> will ſay, no civill Law is violated, becauſe no Law concerning the ſecond Table is violated. But that is his miſtake, to thinke the civill Lawes concerne onely the outward Eſtate of the People, and not their Religion.</p>
               <p>That is a civill Law whatſoever concerneth the good of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the propulſing of the contrary. Now Religion is the beſt good of the City: and therefore Lawes about Religion are truly called civill Lawes, enacted by civill Authority, about the beſt good of the City, for the promoting, and preſerving of that good of the City. But having thus <hi>ſpoken to his ſecond caſe firſt (wherein he ſaith, a falſe Religion will not hurt a civill State.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to his firſt: which was, that a falſe <hi>Religion will not hurt, if it be out of the Church, no more then weeds in the wilderneſſe will hurt the incloſed Garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if the Garden be incloſed in the midſt of a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? what if the weeds grow ſo neere the incloſure (or hedge) round about the Garden, that they eaſily creep into the Garden? what if every blaſt of wind blow the ſeeds of the weeds into the Garden, which are ready to overſpread the Garden, and to choak the good herbes? The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> will ſay, they that keep and dreſſe the Garden ſhould weed them out.</p>
               <p>True, ſo they ought, to their beſt endeavour. But were it not alſo needfull, that the Lord of the ſoyle, who hath his Officers both to dreſſe his Garden &amp; to keep his wildernes, ſhould provide, that the keepers of his wilderneſſe ſhould ſuffer no venomous weeds to grow neere his garden, hedge, or pale, leaſt the ſeeds thereof ſhould annoy his Garden, and poyſon thoſe within the Garden that feed on them?</p>
               <p>It is true, which the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſaith, poyſon will <hi>not hurt the body, unleſſe it be taken, or touched, yea and Antidotes taken againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who ſhall prevent the Members of the Church from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or taking poyſon? or who ſhall provide, that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhall take the Antidotes which are prepared for them? Here will be needfull the faithfull vigilancy of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:160232:78"/>to aſſiſt the Officers of the Church in the Lords worke: the one to lay in Antidotes to prevent infection: the other to weed out infectious noyſome weedes, which the ſheep of Chriſt will be touching and taking, when they will ſometime neglect their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes. It is a very unlikely thing <hi>which the</hi> Diſcuſſer <hi>ſaith (is moſt likely) that</hi> Tertullian <hi>meant one of theſe two caſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For doubtleſſe his meaning was, to plead for the Innocency and impunity of his owne Religion, which was indeed the Truth of God. And he might ſafely plead, that if the Pagan Religion did not hurt their civill Government, (as the Romane Governours doubted not of that) he biddeth them to be ſecure of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, it will never hurt them at all. When therefore he ſpeakes of Religion indefinitely, that one mans <hi>Religion will not hurt another, it is Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> let not <hi>Scapula</hi> ſuſpect hurt from Chriſtian Religion to the Romane State. If the Romane Religion be the preſervation of the Romane Empire (as <hi>Scapula</hi> thought) Chriſtian Religion (though tolerated, yea though recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and advanced) will never be their deſtruction, nor diſturbance.</p>

               <p>For I gather it, not from his quotation of thoſe words of the Apoſtle (which I eaſily graunt, doe clearly ſpeake of Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not of civill cenſure:) But I gather it partly from his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the parralell words in the ſame Chapter: and partly from the words he uſeth in opening that very Text. The parra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell place in the ſame Chap. is <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they were cut off that trouble you.</hi> This cutting off, (or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) He expoundeth the cutting off of their virility which no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will ſay is a Church-Cenſure. I ſpake not here of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text (which doubtleſſe, ſpeaketh of a Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) but of the true meaning of <hi>Ieromes</hi> words.</p>
               <p>Againe, when <hi>Ierome</hi> would have the ſpark, aſſoone as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, to be extinguiſhed, and the leaven to be removed from the reſt of the Dough &amp;c. though it be true (which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer ſpeaketh) that the Apoſtle intendeth a Church-Cenſure: yet doubtleſſe <hi>Ierome</hi> aymed at more in thoſe compariſons, even to a civill cenſure alſo. For to theſe compariſons, he immediately ſubjoyneth theſe words, <hi>Arius in Alexandriâ una ſcintilla fuit: ſed quia non ſtatim oppreſſa eſt, totum orbem, eius flamma de populata eſt. Arius</hi> (ſaith he) was but one ſparkle: yet becauſe he was not ſpeedily executed (or ſuppreſt) his flame depopulated all the world. Where by the extinguiſhing of that ſpark, he doth not meane, by excommunication: for he was not ignorant, that <hi>Arius</hi> had been ſpeedily excommunicate, once and againe out of the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> once whiſt he was Deacon, as <hi>Sozomene</hi> reporteth in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccleſiaſt Hiſtoria, Chap.</hi> 14. And though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he got into the Church againe, yet he was againe excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, when he was <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> and caſt out of his <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> reporteth in his <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccleſiaſt Haſtoria, Cap.</hi> 6. of the Greek Edition; Chap. 3. of the latine. So that <hi>Hierome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, of the great hurt, which the ſparke of <hi>Arius</hi> did, becauſe he was not timely put out, he did not meane, of putting out of the Church (which was done timely enough, and twice for failing) but becauſe he was not put out either out of the world, or at leaſt, out of the Confines of Neighbour Churches.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:160232:79"/>
               <p>Say not: yet <hi>Paul</hi> doubtleſſe ſpake of putting out of the Church. For though that be true: yet now the Queſtion is not of <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement in this place, but of <hi>Hieromes</hi> judgement, which the Author of the Letter alledgeth as a witneſſe for himſelfe, and the Diſcuſſer would maintaine it: though <hi>Ieromes</hi> words will not beare it. It argueth, men are more led by will, then judgement to uphold a cauſe, when the witneſſes which themſelves produce, beare witneſſe againſt them. Neither let any man ſay, That this graunt of his, <hi>That Hereſie muſt be cut off with the Sword of the ſpirit, doth imply an abſolute ſufficiency in the Sword of the Spirit to cut it downe, according to</hi> 2 Cor 10.4, 5.</p>
               <p>For though Spirituall weapons be abſolutely ſufficient to the end for which God hath appointed them (as hath been opened above) to wit, for the conviction, and (if he belong to God) for the converſion of the offender, for the mortifying of his fleſh, &amp; for the ſaying of his ſoule, and for the cleanſing of the Church from the fellowſhip of that guilt: yet if an Hereticke ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinate, and perſiſt in ſeducing, creepe into Houſes, lead captive ſilly ſoules, and deſtroy the faith of ſome, (it may be, of many) ſuch <hi>Gangrenes</hi> would be cut off by another Sword, which in the hand of the Magiſtrate is not borne in vaine.</p>

The Nationall Typicall-State-Church of the</hi> Jewes, <hi>neceſſarily called for ſuch weapons: But the particular Churches of Chriſt in all parts of the world, conſiſting of</hi> Jewes <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>is powerfully able to defend it ſelfe, and offend men, and Divells, although the State and Kingdome (wherein the Churches be) had neither carnall Sword, nor Speare, as once it was in the Nationall Church in the Land of</hi> Canaan; 1 Sam. 13.</p>

               <p>I ſhould think mine eye were very obſcure indeed, if I ſhould run to a <hi>Smiths</hi> ſhop to fetch the Authority of the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate from thence: or if I ſhould thinke his Authority could not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:160232:80"/>be put forth againſt all evill doers (and amongſt others, againſt Hereticks) without a Sword of Iron or Steele. If their be ſtones in the ſtreets, the Magiſtrate need not fetch a Sword from the <hi>Smiths</hi> ſhop, nor an Halter from the Ropers, to puniſh an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. A pleaſant wit can play with a feather of every flying Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and yet (which is to be lamented) bring in ſuch light conceits into grave Diſcourſes, and Diſputes about the holy things of God.</p>
               <p>But two things let the Diſcuſſer underſtand, 1. That the Lord (through his grace) hath opened mine eye many a yeare agoe, to diſcerne, that a Nationall Church is not the Inſtitution of the Lord Jeſus. And himſelfe confeſſeth, that elſwhere I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt againſt ſuch a Church State: nor will he ever be able to make it good, that the Church in <hi>New-England</hi> is implicitely any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, or State-Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let him underſtand further, that I ſhould thinke mine eye not onely obſcured, but the ſight of it utterly put out; if I ſhould conceive, as he doth, That the Nationall Church State of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did neceſſarily call for ſuch weapons to puniſh Hereticks, more then the Congregationall State of particular Churches doth call for the ſame, now in the dayes of the New-Teſtament. For was not the Nationall Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> as compleately furniſhed with ſpirituall Armour to defend it ſelfe, and to offend men: and Divells, as the particular Churches of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be? Had they not power to convince falſe Prophets, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did the Prophets of <hi>Baal?</hi> Had they not power to ſeperate all evil doers from the fellowſhip of the Congregation? what power have our particular Churches now, which their Nationall Church wanted? or what efficacy is their found in the exerciſe of our power which was wanting to them?</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, Their Nation was an holy Nation, and an uncleane perſon might not live amongſt them:</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, he might not enter into the Congregation with the reſt of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to worſhip the Lord: but he was permitted to live in the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> men uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed both in heart, and fleſh.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a Sophyſtical imagination of mans Braine, to make a mans ſelfe, or the world believe, that the Nationall. Church-State of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> required a civill Sword, whereas the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:160232:80"/>Church-State of the Goſpel needs no ſuch help.</p>

                  <hi>BRentius upon</hi> 1 Cor. 3. <hi>ſaith, no man hath power to make or give Lawes to Chriſtians, whereby to binde their Conſciences.

                  <hi>To this the Anſwerer returneth,</hi> Brentius <hi>(ſaith he) ſpeaketh not to your cauſe. Wee willingly graunt you, that man hath no power to binde Conſcience: but this hindereth not, that men may ſee the Lawes of God obſerved, which doe binde Conſcience.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But the graunting this, That men have no power to make Lawes to binde Conſcience, overthroweth ſuch his Tenent, and practiſe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine men from their worſhip, according to their Conſcience, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife, and conſtraine them to ſuch worſhips, which their own ſoules tell them, they have no ſatifaction, nor faith in.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It is an untruth, that either we reſtraine men from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to Conſcience, or conſtraine them to worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſcience: or that ſuch is my Tenent and practiſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer, As God needs not the help of a materiall Sword of Steele to aſſiſt the Sword of the Spirit in the affairs of Conſcience: ſo thoſe men, thoſe Magiſtrates, yea the Common-wealth which makes ſuch Magiſtrates muſt needs have power and Authority from Chriſt Ieſus to ſit Iudge, and to determine in all the great Controverſies concerning Doctrine, Worſhip, Government &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>God needeth not the help of a materiall Sword of Steele, to aſſiſt the Sword of his Spirit of righteouſneſſe in the dutyes of the ſecond Table, no more then to aſſiſt the Sword of the Spirit of holyneſſe in the dutyes of the firſt Table. The Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is as fully and plainly written by the Spirit of God in the hearts and Conſciences of men, as is the Law of holyneſſe: yea and more too. And yet the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> doth not (for ought I know) make it a needleſſe matter for God to accept the helpe of the materiall Sword to aſſiſt the Spirit of Righteouſneſſe in the affaires of Conſcience, which pertaine to the ſecond Table. The truth is, God needeth not the Arme of fleſh to help him, that is, he needeth not any help, which the wiſdome or ſtrength of the creature can invent, or bring forth, which himſelfe appointed not. But yet God thinkes it no diſhonour to himſelfe, to make uſe of his owne Ordinances, in their owne bounds, to his owne ends; Nor doeth he then need them, when he uſeth them, but wee need ſuch helps for the performance of our duty both to God, and man. Which made it a curſed ſin in <hi>Meroz,</hi> not to come out to help the Lord, <hi>Iudge.</hi> 5 23.</p>
               <p>Nor will it hence follow, that ſuch Magiſtrates as are choſen to help forward the work of God in matters of Religion, that either themſelves, <hi>or the Common-wealth that chooſeth them, muſt needs have power, and Authority from Chriſt, to ſit Iudge, and to determine in all great controverſies of Religion, in Doctrine, Diſcipline and Government:</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:160232:81"/>
               <p>It is enough that they are called of God to be wiſe and learned in the ſervice of Chriſt, and in the wayes of his Kingdome. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. which if they have learned, they ought to rule with him, and for him: or elſe how ſhall it be fulfilled, which is written of them, The Kingdomes of the world, are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reigne for ever? <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. Yea in this caſe, it is learning enough, if they know the Principles and Foundations of Religion, and can diſcerne the Arrogancy of a tumultuous ſpirit after conviction For ſuch want not judgement; to cenſure Apoſtacy, to Hereſie in doctrine, to Idolatry in worſhip, to Tyranny in Government.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But then I aske, whether upon this ground, it muſt not evidently follow, that then either there is no Common-wealth, nor Civill State of men in the world, that is not qualified with this diſcerning: (and then the Common-wealth hath more light concerning the Church, then the Church it ſelfe:) Or that the Common-wealth and Magiſtrates thereof muſt judge and puniſh as they are perſwaded in their owne beleife and Conſcience (be their Conſcience, Paganiſh, Turkiſh, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian:) And what is this, but to confound Heaven and Earth together? and to take away not onely the being of Chriſtianity out of the world, but all civility, yea the world out of the world, and to lay all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heaps of confuſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Defender.</label>
               </p>
               <p>See what ſtrange effects, a ſtrong fancy can produce? would you not think, it muſt be ſome ſtrange, and ſtrong paradox, that if it be graunted ſhall produce ſuch ſtrange and ſtrong effects, as to take away the being of Chriſtianity out of the world, yea and all civility, yea and the world out of the world?</p>
               <p>But when men have ſlept a while, and ſtrong fancyes are evaporated, the world will ſtand where it is, and civility ſtand in the world, and Chriſtianity in civility.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore (that which no ſober minde can contradict) that though Magiſtrates be bound to become wiſe and learned, to know Chriſt, and to eſtabliſh the Religion of Chriſt yet it will not (as the Diſcuſſer ſaith) evidently follow, no nor follow at all, <hi>That then there is no law full Commonwealth nor Civill State of men in the world, which is not qualified with this ſpirituall diſcerning.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:160232:82"/>
               <p>For though it be the duty of Civill States, thus to be qualified: yet their want of ſuch qualifications, doth not make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull States. Many due qualifications are required in Husbands, Wives, Children, Servants, Magiſtrates, Churches, the want of which maketh them defective, and ſinfull, but doth not make them unlawfull. This will need no proofe to any ſober minde.</p>
               <p>Muchleſſe will it follow upon the former Premiſes, <hi>that the very Common-wealth hath then more light concerning the Church of Chriſt, then the Church it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is a weake Church, that knowes no more light, then Principles: And what light the Common-wealth hath, it may have received from the Church. Howſoever, the Magiſtrates power to eſtabliſh the Religion of Chriſt doth no way inferre. That he that eſtabliſheth that Religion, which is profeſſed in the Church, hath more light concerning that Religion, or any part of it, then the Church it ſelfe. Albeit, it is not impoſſible, nor is it abſurd that ſometime the Magiſtrate may have more light in matters of Religion, then the Church it ſelfe. <hi>David</hi> (for ought wee read) was the firſt that diſcerned the diſorder in Carting the Arke of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was the firſt, that prevented the Preiſts and <hi>Levits,</hi> and the whole Church, in the worke of Reformation, from the Apoſtacy of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.4, to 11.</p>
               <p>But there is no colour of conſequence, that becauſe Magiſtrates are bound to diſcerne, and know the will of Chriſt, and to ſerve him with their power, That therefore ſuch as have no diſcerning of Chriſt, nor of his holy will, That they ſhould puniſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſt, and Chriſtians, and ſeeke only to advance their owne Religion, which is but Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly, that the Church of Chriſt doth not uſe the Arme of ſecular power, to compell men to the true profeſſion of the Truth. For this is to be done with ſpirituall weapons, whereby Chriſtians are to be exhorted, and compelled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hindereth not,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſtians ſinning againſt the Light of Faith, and Conſcience, may juſtly be cenſured of the Church, by Excommunication, and of the civill Magiſtrate alſo, in caſe they ſhall corrupt others to the perdition of their ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Joynt-confeſſion of the Anſwerer with</hi> Luther <hi>(to wit, that the Government of the civill Magiſtrate extendeth no further then over the bodyes and goods of their Subjects, not over their ſoules) who ſeeth not, that hereby is given a cleare Teſtimony, that either the ſpirituall and Church Eſtate, the preaching of the word, Baptiſme, Miniſtery, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, belongeth to the civill body of the Common-wealth, (that is, to the bodies and goods of men, which ſeemeth monſtrous to Imagine:) or elſe, that the civill Magiſtrate cannot (without exceeding the bounds of his Office) meddle with thoſe ſpirituall Affaires.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A man that is willing to open his eyes, may eaſily ſee, that though the Government of the civill Magiſtrate doe extend no further then over the bodies and goods of his Subjects, yet he may and ought to improve that power over their bodies and goods, to the good of their ſoules: yea and by promoting the good of their ſoules, he may much advance the good of their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:160232:83"/>outward man alſo. The bodies, and goods, and outward Eſtates of men may expect a bleſſing, when their ſoules proſper. Though God may keep his Saints low in outward Eſtate, that grow faſteſt in Godlineſſe: yet ſure Godlineſſe hath the Promiſes of this life, and of a better, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And ſuch as firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of God, may expect all theſe outward things to be caſt in upon them. If it ſeeme a monſtrous thing in the eyes of the <hi>Diſcuſſer,</hi> to imagine, that the good Eſtate of the Church, and the well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Ordinances of God therein, ſhould concerne the civill good of the Common-wealth, it may well ſeeme monſtrous to him, to imagine that the flouriſhing of Religion is the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the civill State, and the decay of Religion is the decay and ruine of the civill State. But ſuch Virgine ſoules, as follow the Lamb, whereſoever he goeth (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.) would be loath to goe to live in ſuch a Common-wealth, to whom it ſhould ſeeme mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, that the things of God ſhould belong to them.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Magiſtrate need not to feare, that he ſhould exceed the bounds of his Office, if he ſhould meddle with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall affaires of the Church in Gods way. It is true, if he ſhall meddle with the execution of a Miniſters Office, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> did or if he ſhall ſet up humane Inventions in Doctrine, Worſhip, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in ſtead of Chriſts Inſtitutions, as <hi>David</hi> brought the Arke of God upon Oxen, inſtead of the ſhoulders of the Levites: Or if he ſhall thruſt in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts upon the Church, and caſt out faithfull Miniſters: or if he ſhall make Lawes to bind Conſcience, in all theſe, or any ſuch Like, he exceedeth the bounds of his Office. But if he ſhall diligently ſeeke after the Lord, and read in the word of the Lord all the dayes of his life (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19.) that he may both live as a Chriſtian, and rule as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if he ſhall ſeeke to eſtabliſh and advance the Kingdome of Chriſt more then his owne: If he ſhall incourage the good in a Chriſtian courſe, and diſcourage ſuch as have evill will to <hi>Sion:</hi> and puniſh none for matter of Religion, but ſuch as ſubvert the Principles of ſaving Truth (which no good Chriſtian, much leſſe good Magiſtrate can be ignorant of) or at leaſt ſuch as diſturbe the Order of the Goſpel in a turbulent way, verily the Lord will build up and eſtabliſh the Houſe and Kingdome of ſuch Princes, as doe thus build up his.</p>

                  <hi>Againe neceſſarily it muſt follow that theſe two are contradictory to themſelves (which yet both of them are Mr.</hi> Cottons <hi>Poſitions</hi>) <hi>the Magiſtrates Power extends no further then to the bodyes and goods of the Subject: and yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Magiſtrate muſt puniſh Chriſtians for ſinning againſt the Light of Faith and Conſcience, and for corrupting the ſoules of men.</hi>

               <p>If the Chriſtian Faith, and a good Conſcience be a part, and a great part, a chiefe part of the good of Chriſtians, then theſe two are ſo farre from contradicting one another, that they eſtabliſh one another. For if a Magiſtrates power extend to the preſerving of the Goods of the Subject, and to the puniſhment of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachers or purloyners thereof: then he falleth ſhort of his duty, if he ſuffer their Faith and good Conſcience to be corrupted or diſpoyled without revenge. Againe, this I ſay further (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will eaſily avoyde appearance of Contradiction) ſuppoſe by Goods were meant onely outward Goods, and that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power extended no further then the bodies and goods of the Subjects: yet though he have no power over Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he hath nevertheleſſe lawfull power to puniſh ſuch evill doers in their Bodies and goods, as doe ſeduce his people to make ſhipwrack of Faith, and a good Conſcience. For in ſeeking Gods Kingdome and Righteouſneſſe, men proſper in their outward Eſtates, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. otherwayes they decay. Beſides, I doe not remember, that this Propoſition is any of mine (which yet the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> faſtneth upon me) that the <hi>Magiſtrates power extendeth no further then the bodies and Goods of his Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe not deny the Truth of it, rightly underſtood, but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me ſomewhat too looſe, and confuſed, for me to owne it as mine own. For the Magiſtrates power may be ſaid to extend no further then the bodyes and Goods of his Subjects, either as the Subject of his power, or as the end of his power. If Goods be meant outward Goods, and the Magiſtrates power be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no further then to the body and Goods of his Subjects, as to the Object of his power, the Poſition is true. But if it be meant of the end of his power, as if a Magiſtrates power reached no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the preſervation of their bodyes, and outward Goods,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:160232:84"/>it is falſe For the Adequate end of the Magiſtrates power, is <gap reason="foreign">

Now can it be well with a Common-wealth, that liveth in bodily health, and worldly wealth, but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Church, without Chriſt, without God in the world? But though God for a time may preſerve a civill State in health and wealth, through his Patience, and bounty, eſpecially till meanes of Grace be offered to them: yet after meanes of Grace be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they cannot long expect bodily health, or wealth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to them, if they neglect, or deſpiſe, or depart from ſo great ſalvation. Witneſſe the Romane Empire, which though it abounded in worldly bleſſings, till the Lord Jeſus came riding forth amongſt them upon a White Horſe of the Goſpel of his Grace: yet after they neglected ſo great Salvation, then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Red Horſe of Warre, and a black Horſe of Famine, and a Pale Horſe of Peſtilence and other Judgements, which much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached both the health, and wealth of that State, and would have ruined it, had it not caſt away her Idolls, and advanced the Scepter of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>I cannot ſay, nor doe I beleive, that any man is compelled to come to our Church, againſt his Conſcience. Nay we are ſo farre from that, (and that the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> is not ignorant of) that our Churches doe not expoſtulate with our Members who heare in <hi>England,</hi> no not then, when there was more difference from us in manner of worſhip, then (through the mercy of God) now there is. The which the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> himſelfe hath declared to have been no little Offence unto himſelfe. Which maketh me the more to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, that he ſhould now charge it upon us, that we compell all to come to heare in our Churches, againſt their Conſciences: when he is wont to be offended, that we ſuffer them to heare in any true Church (though polluted) according to their Conſciences.</p>

               <p>I cannot call to mind, that either upon that colour, or any other, any man in this Country was ever compelled to heare the word of God, in any of our Churches, in this Country. But there is indeed ſome colour for the varniſh he ſpeaketh of: but not that which he pretendeth (our compulſion of any man for to heare:) but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with himſelfe upon another occaſion, as I remember.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> ſometimes endeavoured to draw away the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> (whereof he was ſometime Teacher) from holding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all the Churches in the <hi>Bay,</hi> becauſe wee tolerated our Members to heare the word in the Pariſhes of <hi>England.</hi> Wee to ſatisfie him in that, held forth (that which here he calleth a varniſh) that hearing was a common Duty lying upon all men, where the word of God was truly taught. He replyed, as he doth now, that Teaching and hearing in a Church-Eſtate is Church worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. To which we gave Anſwer (as now againe) That though Teaching and being taught in a Church-Eſtate be Church-worſhip (according to <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46.) yet it is not a Church-worſhip, but to ſuch as are in a Church-Eſtate. To all it is an holy Ordinance of Gods worſhip, and a Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And though Teaching and hearing doth imply a Relation, yet not a Church-relation. There is a relation between a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and a Learner, in any Art, or Knowledge: and there may be a nearer relation between a Preacher and an Hearer, in caſe the Hearer be begotten to God by ſuch a Sermon (even the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as is between a ſpirituall Father, and Sonne:) but this doth not amount to Church-relation, and Communion, till there paſſe ſome mutuall profeſſion of Covenant (explicit or implicit) between them. A Pagan Infidell may come into a Chriſtian Church-Aſſembly to heare the word, and may be convinced and converted by it, (as ſuppoſe he in <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 14.24, 25.) yet is he not therefore joyned in Church-Eſtate, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, without profeſſion of acknowledgement, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>

               <p>But what is this to ſuch as being converted to the Profeſſion of the Faith, doe Apoſtate from the Faith, and ſeeke to ſubvert the Faith, which they have profeſſed?

               <p>What we have opened out of <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8. againſt Perſecution, when (as he ſaith) wee were under the Hatches, amounted to this, That it was lawfull for the ſheep of Chriſt, to follow Chriſt, and and to come along with him, and flye away from perſecution. Did any of us then teach, that it was unlawfull for Magiſtrates to purſue with juſt revenge Apoſtate Seducers unto Idolatry, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or blaſphemy? or turbulent ſubverters of civill or Church-Order? And ſince we are come hither, where he is pleaſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us with ſitting at Helme (which is farre from us) what have we taught or practiſed more, then our ſelves allowed in times of our owne reſtraint?

               <p>We keep not a weight and a weight (as he calumniateth) a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and a meaſure: what we meaſure out to others, wee ſhould never thinke it hard meaſure to have the ſame returned to our ſelves in the like caſe, Onely this meaſure we deſire of all hands to be kept (that which <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, and God the Judge of all the Earth, thought equall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25.) that the Righteous ſhould not be as the wicked: nor that Truth, and Fidelity, ſhould ſuffer as Hereſie and Apoſtacy.</p>

               <p>It is a feeble kind of reaſoning, from a ſimilitude in ſome things, to preſſe a reſemblance in every thing: Sheep doe fitly reſemble Chriſtians in many proprieties: but he that ſhall therefore preſſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:160232:87"/>them to be like in all, ſhall not ſuffer a Magiſtrate (if he be a ſheep of Chriſt) to puniſh Robbers, Adulterers, Murderers: why? for it is againſt the Nature of true ſheep, to perſecute any Beaſts of the Forreſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I demand, whether <hi>Paul</hi> was a ſheep, or a Wolfe, when he ſmote <hi>Elymas</hi> with blindneſſe?

               <p>Furthermore, when the Wolfe runneth ravenouſly upon the ſheep, is it againſt the nature of the true ſheep, to run to their Shepheard? And is it then againſt the Nature of the true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to ſend forth his Dogs to worry ſuch a Wolfe, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the reproach of a perſecutor?</p>

                  <hi>Secondly, if it be a Duty and charge upon all Magiſtrates in all parts of the world to judge and perſecute, in, and for ſpirituall Cauſes, then either they are no Magiſtrates, who are not able to judge in ſuch caſes: or elſe they muſt judge according to their Conſciences, whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Turkiſh, or Antichriſtian.</hi>

               <p>This hath been againe, and againe Anſwered above, though it be the Duty of all Magiſtrates in the world, to judge and puniſh Blaſphemers, Idolaters, and Seducers: yet not <hi>in ſenſu compoſite,</hi> whilſt they are ignorant of the Truth, and cannot judge of ſuch cauſes: but <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> they are bound to be wiſe, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the knowledge, and worſhip of Chriſt, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10.11, 12.) and then to judge accordingly.</p>
               <p>But in the meane time, it doth not follow, that they are no Magiſtrates, who are not able to doe all the Duties of a Magiſtrate. Neither will it follow, that they muſt judge according to their Conſciences, when their Conſciences are blind, and erroneous, Pagan, Turkiſh, Antichriſtian. Let them firſt caſt Beames out of their owne eyes, and then they will better diſcerne between Beame, and motes in other men.</p>

It is not Light, but darkneſſe, that cloudeth the Light already revealed. Nor is it darkneſſe onely, but blackneſſe of darkneſſe, that putteth Light for darkneſſe, and darkneſſe for Light, and would have both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated to live together in the ſame Hemiſpheare, becauſe ſome blinde Chriſtians cannot yet tell, which is whether?</p>
               <p>It is true, the Experience of former Errours, and ſenſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent weakneſſes, may juſtly abate the edge, and ſheath up the Sword of perſecution againſt any, that differ onely in errours of weakeneſſe, and differ not in Doctrines of Faith, Repentance, and Holineſſe of heart, and life. Yea wee willingly grant more, then the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> requireth in ſuch a caſe. For though there ſhould bee ſome Difference in Doctrines of faith, or Repentance, or Holineſſe; Yet wee ſhould not approve the unſheathing of the Sword againſt ſuch, unleſſe the Doctrine were fundamentally ſubverſive to faith, or Repentance, or Holineſſe, and that obſtinately maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light, and conviction: and broached, and diſperſed to the Infection, and Seduction of others.</p>
               <p>If the Difference be only in the way and manner of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt Ieſus, and that Difference held forth in a Chriſtian and Peaceable way. God forbid a ſtaffe ſhould be ſhaken againſt ſuch, much leſſe a Sword unſheathed.</p>

                  <hi>This Rhetoricall perſwaſion of humane wiſdome ſeemeth very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Eye of fleſh, and bloud: but one Scripture more prevaileth with faithfull and obedient ſoules, then thouſands of plauſible, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſpeeches.</hi>

               <p>Neither this Teſtimony, nor the reſt of thoſe Ancients that follow, were alledged to prevaile with the Faith of any, further then Light of Scripture might ſhine forth in them: but onely to counterpoyſe the Teſtimonies of the Ancients alledged in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the Truth. And the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> in his entrance into this chapter, is forced to acknowledge, that the cauſe wee maintaine hath more number of Votes (and I may adde, weight of Voters) then the contrary Tenent: onely he putteth it off with this eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: that Antichriſt <hi>is too hard for Chriſt at Votes, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which yet is the more to be marvelled at, that when the cauſe is about the Toleration of Hereticks, and Antichriſtians, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhould procure more Votes againſt Antichriſtians, and Chriſt to procure any Votes, though fewer for them. And it is but another evaſion, whereby he here putteth off <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſpeech, as if it were but a Rhetoricall evaſion. Whereas indeed the weight of the ſpeech lyeth not in the Rhetorick, which is little, or none: but in the Logick, in an Argument taken from the Excellency of the ſoule above the body, and thence inferring the equity of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the bodies of ſuch, as kill the ſoules of Gods people, and the iniquity of ſuch, as think this unequall.</p>
               <p>But to weaken the force of this Argument, the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to draw up ſixe Anſwers.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:160232:89"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the large extent of ſoule-killing, which may reach to many ſinnes, that are not capitall,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the diſſimilitude of bodily, and ſpirituall Death. A body being killed can dye but once: but a ſoule killed may recover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the different puniſhment, which Chriſt hath provided for ſoule-killers: to wit the two edged Sword, which cometh out of his mouth, which is able to cut downe Hereſie, and to kill the ſoules of Hereticks everlaſtingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>From the toleration, which Chriſt himſelfe giveth to ſuch ſoule-killers, or ſoule-wounders, in the Parable of Tares,</hi> Matth. 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>From the impoſſibility of killing any ſoule by any Heretick: not the ſoules of naturall men: for they are dead already: nor can falſe Teachers ſo much prevent the meanes of ſpirituall Life, as doth the force of a materiall Sword, either impriſoning the ſoules of men in a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall-State-Religion: or cutting them off immediately without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meanes of Repentance. Nor can there be a killing of the ſoules of men alive in Chriſt, partly by reaſon of the ſufficiency and power of Spirituall Ordinances to preſerve that Life in them againſt all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly, from the Immortality of the ſpirituall Life in Chriſt, which can no more dye then Chriſt himſelfe who is alive for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>From the poſſbility of a falſe Teachers, and a Wolves recovery from the Eſtate of a ſoule-killer, to become a ſoule-ſaver, as it was in the caſe of</hi> Paul.</p>
               <p>For a juſt <hi>Reply</hi> to all theſe, let me firſt premiſe foure things: and then ſpeake to the Arguments in Order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not every murther of the body, that is a capitall crime, but murder executed in ſome groſſe Attempt. <hi>For he that hateth his brother is a man-ſlayer, or murderer</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.) and yet not for that to be put to death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Murder unadviſedly committed, when the Act done was not intended, is not a capitall crime: there were Cities of Refuge provided in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 21.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very Attempt of murder, in the abuſe of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, is a capitall crime. As in a caſe, a man ſhall riſe up before a Court of Juſtice to beare falſe witneſſe againſt his Neighbour, of ſome capitall offence, this very attempt of killing his Neighbour by the abuſe of publick Juſtice, is a capitall crime, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.18. to 21.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:160232:89"/>
               <p n="4">4. The murther of the ſoule is not the onely <hi>Formalis Ratio</hi> (as they call it) the onely proper cauſe of an Hereticks capitall Crime, but chiefly his bitter roote of Apoſtacie from God, not onely falling off himſelfe from God, but ſeducing others to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure things being premiſed, come wee now to conſider of the ſeverall Anſwers given by the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> to <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>His firſt Anſwer reacheth not the point: for as every killing of the body is not a capitall crime, ſo neither is every killing of the ſoule, but ſuch as is more voluntary, and preſumptuous, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſome groſſe and murderous attempt.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer falleth ſhort in this reſpect, that though a ſoule wounded and killed may recover againe, yet the very mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Attempt of killing a ſoule, in abuſing an Ordinance of God, in corrupting Religion, is a capitall crime, whether the ſoule dye of that wound or no: or if it dye whether it be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or no. <hi>Thine eye ſhall not ſpare him, becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut 13.10. <hi>Though hee did not thruſt thee away, yet becauſe he ſought to doe it hee ſhall dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third Anſwer hath been removed above. Church-cenſures are ſufficient to heale the Heretick, if he belong to God, and to remove the guilt of his wickedneſſe from the Church: but not ſufficient, to prevent his further ſpreading of the Leaven of his corruption: nor ſufficient to cleanſe the Common-wealth from the guilt of ſuch Rebellion, as hath been taught by him againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>His fourth Anſwer taken from Chriſts toleration of the Tares hath be en largely, and (as I conceive) fully refelled above.</p>
               <p>His fifth Anſwer hath alſo been cleared already. If the Anſwer were good, it would evacuate not onely <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Argument, but <hi>Pauls</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.11. <hi>Paul</hi> diſſwadeth from eating things ſacrificed to Idols in Idols Temples. The Argument to diſſwade it, is from the offence thereby given to the Conſcience of the weake: and that backed and ſtrengthned from the haynouſneſſe of the ſinne of offence to Conſcience: It is the murder, or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of a weake Brothers ſoule. Now if this Anſwer of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:160232:90"/>might ſtand, it would make the Argument of the Apoſtle of none effect. For either this weake Brother is a <hi>naturall man, dead in ſinne already, and then no man can kill him: or elſe he is in Chriſt, and then his Life is immortall, and Chriſt hath provided Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances powerfully ſufficient to prevent or heale ſuch deadly Dangers,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an high preſumptuous tempting of God, and wanton treading under foote the precious ſoules of men for whom Chriſt dyed, to wound and (as much as in us lyeth) to kill the ſoules of men, upon pretence, the Lord can ſave them, and raiſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by his all-ſufficient Grace. It is a putting of feare, where none is, that the puniſhment of obſtinate ſeducing <hi>Hereticks with the materiall Sword, is the impriſoning of the ſoules of</hi> men to a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Religion: for if the Religion of the Nation be good, it is no Impriſonment: if naught, there ſhould be no puniſhment. And it is a like cauſleſſe Feare, that, the cutting off of Hereticks, <hi>will cut off men immediately without any longer meanes of Repentance:</hi> for if they belong to God, God will give them Repentance before they goe hence: but whether they belong to God, or no, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God is fulfilled in their juſt Execution.</p>
               <p>The laſt Anſwer falleth as ſhort of ſtrength, as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For if men be ſuch Wolves, and Blaſphemers as <hi>Paul</hi> was, before his Converſion, neither the Law of God or man would put ſuch an one to Death, who ſinned of ignorance, and walked (as himſelfe profeſſeth) with all good Conſcience, even in his former evill times, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. But as for ſuch as Apoſtate from the known Truth of Religion, and ſeeke to ſubvert the Foundation of it, and to draw away others from it, to plead for their Toleration in hope of their Converſion, is as much as to proclaime a generall pardon for all malefactors, (ſave ſuch onely as ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt:) for he that is a wilfull murderer, and Adulterer now, may come to be converted and dye a martyr hereafter.</p>

               <p>Whether theſe ſhafts be taken from the Quiver of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and Typicall State of the Nationall Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or no: Sure this Anſwer is taken from no Law of God, nor any Scripture ground: but from the Topicks of humane invention.</p>
               <p>Did ever any Apoſtle or Evangiliſt, make the judiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning life and death, Ceremoniall, or Typicall?

               <p>It is true the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe hath ſet up another Church, Miniſtery, and Worſhip: But did he ever ſet up another civill Righteouſneſſe? or a M giſtracy to walke by another rule of Righteouſneſſe, then that which God gave by <hi>Moſes?</hi> If it be true, that Chriſt gave no expreſſe Ordinance, Precept, or Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of killing men by materiall Swords for Religion ſake: It is as true that neither did he for any breach of civill Juſtice, no not for murder, nor adultry. Which maketh it therefore evident, that ſeeing he hath expreſly authorized civill Magiſtracy in the New-Teſtament, and hath given no expreſſe Lawes or Rules of Righteouſneſſe for them to walke by in Adminiſtration of civill Juſtice, therefore either he leaveth them to act and rule without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:160232:91"/>a Rule (which derogateth from the perfection of Scripture:) or elſe they muſt fetch their rules of Righteouſneſſe from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from the Prophets, who have expounded him in the Old-Teſtament.</p>

               <p>Was it for bodily or corporal filthineſſe? Surely for ſpiritual.

               <p>It will doe the Diſcuſſer no hurt to take notice, that he that is forward to take hold of any ſlip of Pen, or memory, is ſubject to the like ſlips himſelf.

               <p>That I onely quoted the Names of thoſe bleſſed men of God, It was partly becauſe it was enough to counterpoiſe the Names of Authors alledged by the Letter againſt the Truth, by the Names of greater and more holy men of God, for the Truth: partly alſo, becauſe if I had quoted their grounds, I muſt have tranſcribed their whole Bookes of the Argument. <hi>Calvines</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about it, againſt <hi>Servetus,</hi> is bound up in his <hi>Opuſcula.

That Argument from the Parable Let both grow together to the Harveſt is not at all expounded in the Interpretation, Let Seducers be ſuffered to live in the world till the laſt Judgement. And how weake a Foundation that is, to caſt a curſe upon a choſen Apoſtle, or upon an holy Angell, I hope hath been cleared in diſcuſſing that Text.</p>

                  <hi>Let me finiſh the whole, by propoſing one Concluſion of the Author of the arguments in the Letter, viz. It is no prejudice to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if Liberty of Conſcience were ſuffered to ſuch, as feare God indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Abraham <hi>abode a long time amongſt the</hi> Canaanites: <hi>though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in Religion &amp;c. So did</hi> Iſaac: <hi>ſo did</hi> Jacob <hi>twentie yeares with his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> Laban.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were about foure and thirty yeares in</hi> Aegypt: <hi>and afterwards ſeventie in</hi> Babylon, <hi>differing from Religion in both States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come to the time of Chriſt,</hi> Iſrael <hi>lived under the</hi> Romans, <hi>and divers Sects in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>beſides Chriſt, and his Apoſtles &amp;c. All theſe lived under</hi> Caeſars <hi>Government, being nothing hurtfull to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, giving to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>that which was his. And for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he left them to themſelves, as having no Dominion over their ſoules and Conſciences. And when the enemies of the Truth raiſed up any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, the wiſdome of the Magiſtrates moſt wiſely appeaſed them,</hi> Acts. 18.14. <hi>and</hi> 19.35. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, That without prejudice to the Common-wealth, Liberty of Conſcience may be ſuffered to ſuch as feare God indeed: as knowing they will not perſiſt in Hereſie, or turbulent Schiſme, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in Conſcience of the ſinfulneſſe thereof</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Queſtion is whether an Heretick after once or twice Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition (and ſo after conviction) or any other ſcandalous and heynous Offender, may be Tolerated either in the Church, without Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: or in the Common-wealth without ſuch puniſhment, as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve others from dangerous and damnable infection</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But here I Obſerve the <hi>Diſcuſſers</hi> both partiality and faſhood. Partiality, for I did but repeate the very words of the Author of the Letter, and graunt them to be good. The Letter had ſaid (as himſelf repeateth it, <hi>It is no prejudice to a Common-wealth if Liberty of Conſcience were ſuffered to ſuch as feare God indeed: whereto I ſubjoyne my Atteſtation, It is true, that without prejudice to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Liberty of Conſcience may be ſuffered to men that feare God indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> in me obſerveth Partiality: but in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very ſame ſpeech paſſeth for Currant, and approveable. But the Lord help him to remember <hi>Divers weights, and divers meaſures are abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20.10. But I truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in his ſpeech, not onely partiality, but falſhood alſo. For it is a very falſhood, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>None but ſuch as truly feare God ſhould injoy Liberty of Conſcience. I ſay no more then the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith: It ſaith, That it is no prejudice to the Common-wealth, if Liberty of Conſcience were ſuffered to ſuch as feare God indeed.</hi> I ſay, It is true, without prejudice to the Common-wealth, Liberty of Conſcience may be ſuffered to ſuch as feare God indeed. Now if a man ſhould gather the ſame Obſervation out of the Letter, <hi>That none but ſuch as truly feare God ſhould injoy Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> I beleive the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> would obſerve notorious falſhood in ſuch dealing. And juſtly he might: for it is one thing to ſay, liberty of Conſcience may be ſuffered to men that truly feare God, without prejudice to the Common-wealth: another thing to ſay, it may be ſuffered to none elſe.</p>
               <p>I eaſily grant, nor did I ever deny it, that the Inhabitants of the world, though they never come into the eſtate of men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, yet they may and ought to be ſuffered to live in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:160232:94"/>world, unleſſe they diſturbe the Countries of the world where they live, with ſome Capitall Crimes. And if they doe diſturbe the Countries where they live, they ſtand and fall to the Lawes, and Governments of the Countries where they inhabite.</p>
               <p>And therefore all the dangerous conſequences, which the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer</hi> gathereth from my ſpeech (but indeed not my ſpeech, but his owne) <hi>as if I ſhould drive the world out of the world, or turne the world upſide downe, or leave it to men that have not Gods feare, to judge who feare God, and who not,</hi> and the reſt that follow, they are all of them conſequences without an Anticedent, or an Anticedent without exſiſtence in any ſpeech of mine, but onely in his owne imagination.</p>
               <p>Neither hath it any better ground, that paſſionate exclamation of his, with which he endeth this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heare (ſaith he) O Heavens, and give eare O Earth, yea let the Heavens be aſtoniſhed, and the Earth tremble at ſuch an Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Anſwer, thinke you, might this be, that might provoke not the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> onely, but the Heavens and earth to ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admiration, trembling, aſtoniſhment?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer (forſooth) <hi>is that which he calleth a wonderfull An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which the Miniſters of</hi> New-England <hi>gave to the third Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſent to them by ſome Miniſters of</hi> Old-England, <hi>to wit, that although they confeſſed them to be ſuch perſons whom they approved of, farre above themſelves, yea who were in their hearts to live and die together: yet if they or other godly people with them, comming over to them, ſhould differ in Church-Conſtitution, they then could not approve their civill Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with them and conſequently could not adviſe their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to ſuffer them to injoy a civill being within their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſure, if there were any ſuch Anſwer to be found in that Booke ſounding to ſuch a purpoſe, I my ſelfe ſhould joyne with him in the like exclamation, and wonderment. But when I came to ſearch for that ſpeech, and neither finde it in the Anſwer which he quoteth to the third Queſtion, nor in that, which I rather thinke he meant, the 31. I cannot but admire and adore the righteous Judgement of God, who having left the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> (in this Booke, and ſome other) to write againſt the Truth in point of Doctrine, hath herein left him to breake forth in his owne
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:160232:94"/>hand-writing, into notorious impudent falſhood in matter of fact: which any man that readeth that Booke cannot but diſcerne in this Allegation. The Anſwer is too large for me to tranſcribe, but who ſo will may reade it, and when he compareth the Anſwer in that Booke, with the Anſwer in this, he may well wonder with what heart and forhead, the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> could ſo expreſſe it.</p>

               <p>This violence to the ſouls &amp; bodyes of men is often charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the <hi>Diſcuſſer:</hi> But he hath not yet given us an inſtance of any one ſoule or body, which hath undergone this violence from us. <hi>Si Accuſaſſe fufficiat, quis innocens exit?</hi> It is no new practiſe to be an Accuſer of the Brethren: neither is their any ſlaunder ſo falſe or ſcurrilous, but findeth ready, yea and greedy intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even of many profeſſors, eſpecially ſuch, whoſe beſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lyeth in the obſerving and cenſuring the wayes of others.

               <p>
                  <hi>And I adde, according to this Concluſion it muſt follow, that if the moſt godly perſons yeeld not to once or twice Admonition (as is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned by the Anſwerer) they muſt neceſſarily be eſteemed obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for if they were godly, they would yeeld.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here againe the <hi>Diſcuſſer</hi> miſreporteth my words: For I did not ſay, that if perſons be godly, they would yeeld to once or twice Admonition: and if they did not yeeld to once or twice Admonition, they muſt neceſſarily be eſteemed obſtinate perſons. But my words were, <hi>The godly will not perſiſt in Hereſie or turbulent Schiſme, when they are convinced in Conſcience of the ſinfulneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is then a three-fold wreſting of my words, &amp; accordingly ſo much falſe dealing. For 1. Admonition is one thing: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in their owne Conſcience, is another. For though Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition ought not to be diſpenſed till after conviction: yet it may fall out, that the Church (through miſtake) proceedeth to Admonition, before the Offender be convinced in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the ſinfulneſſe of his way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He carrieth my words, as if they who yeeld not to once or twice Admonition muſt needs be eſteemed obſtinate perſons: whereas I onely ſay, they will not perſiſt in Hereſie, (that is, in obſtinacy of Fundamentall Error) nor in turbulent Schiſme, when they are convinced in Conſcience of the ſinfulneſſe thereof.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:160232:96"/>
               <p n="3">3. He propoundeth my words generally, as if I had ſaid that godly perſons (in whatſovever Error they hold) if they yeeld not to once or twice Admonition, they muſt needs be eſteemed obſtinate. whereas I ſpake not of every Error, but of perſiſting in Hereſie and turbulent Schiſme.</p>
               <p>But you may ſee how farre the love of an Error, and deſire of contention, will tranſport the minde and ſpirit!</p>
               <p>The two ſtories that he telleth, upon this occaſion (in his next words) becauſe he nameth neither time, nor perſons, nor occaſions of the ſpeeches (which he repreſenteth as odious) a ſhort Anſwer will ſerve to them. 1. I have too much experience of the <hi>Diſcuſſers</hi> miſtakes of permanent Printed words, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am affraid to credit every report of tranſient words ſpoken, without further Teſtimony. 2.

               <p>The latter part of my Anſwer which he ſaith, cometh not neere the Queſtion, I now underſtand ſo much by the <hi>Diſcuſſer:</hi> but it did not ſo appeare to me by the Author of the Letter.</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:160232:96"/>
               <p n="2">2. I doe not ſay in this concluſion, that I have removed the grounds of his Error: but that I have ſpoken ſo much for that end: but whether I have done it or no (according to the helpe of Chriſt received) I leave others to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The name of a great Error is foiſted in by himſelfe, <hi>ad exaggerandam gloriationis invidiam et indignitatem:</hi> but though the Error be indeed great: yet I did not ſo ſtile it, when I ſpake of mine owne endeavour to remove the grounds of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is an evident falſhood that I ſhould conclude, <hi>This to be that great Error, That perſons are not to be perſecuted for cauſe of Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is that which in ſtating the Queſtion, I did in expreſſe termes deny, that any was to be perſecuted for cauſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: no not an Heretick, no not in a Church-way, much leſſe in a civill way till being convinced in his owne Conſcience of his wickedneſſe, he do ſtand out therein, not only againſt the Truth, but againſt the light of his owne Conſcience, that ſo it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, he is not perſecuted for cauſe of Conſcience, but puniſhed for ſinning againſt his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Onely this, I now further adde, which I know not, whether I had not occaſion to ſpeake to in this Diſcourſe hitherto (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in a touch) that ſometime it may be an aggravation of ſinne both in judgement and practiſe, that a man holdeth it, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in Conſcience. But that is onely in caſe, when a man hath been wonted to ſin ſo oft againſt his light, and againſt the cleare Principles of Truth, and godlineſſe, that it may appeare, the juſt curſe of God hath given him up to a reprobate-blinded-minde, and ſeared Conſcience. But of that wee have not had occaſion to diſpute in this Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>Were I (ſaith he) beleived in this, That Chriſt is not delighted with the bloud of men, (but ſhed his owne bloud for his bloudyeſt enemies:) That by the word of Chriſt, No man for gainſaying Chriſt, or joyning with his enemy Antichriſt, ſhould be moleſted with the Civill ſword: were this foundation laid, and the</hi> Magna Charta <hi>of higheſt Liberties, and good ſecurity given on all hands for the preſervation of it, How ſoone would every Brow and Houſe be ſtuck with Olive Branches?</hi>

               <p>Whether this be not to Conclude with confident perſwaſion (the ſame, and farre greater then that which he noted in me, even now) I matter not.

               <p>But this is not, pleaſing to Chriſt, nor to the Spirit of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Truth, that the <hi>Diſouſſer</hi> ſhould publiſh the delights of Chriſt in a confuſſed way, without diſtinguiſhing things that differ, and ſo not dividing the Word aright. <hi>It is true, that Chriſt delighteth not in the bloud of men, but ſhed his owne for his bloudieſt enemies, and gainſayers:</hi> to wit, whilſt they gainſaying him, and bloudily perſecute him, or his out of ignorance. In this caſe indeed, he prayeth for them, and dieth for them, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe,</hi> Luk. 23.34. <hi>whileſt wee were enemies Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8, 10.</p>
               <p>But to ſay that Chriſt delighteth not in the bloud of men, who after the acknowledgement of his Truth doe tread the bloud of his Covenant under foote, and wittingly and willingly reject him from reigning over them: To hold it forth, that Chriſt delighteth not in the bloud of ſuch men, or that he would not have ſuch moleſted by the civill Sword, who gainſay Chriſt known and profeſſed, and joyn with his enemy Antichriſt, in blaſpheming and perſecuting Chriſt and his Saints, This the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſer</hi> can never make good to be the word of Chriſt. It is indeed, to publiſh the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, not to the humble and meeke <hi>Lambes</hi> of Chriſt, but to the ſeed of the Serpent, to ſow pillowes under all elbowes: to make the hearts of the righteous ſad, whom God would not make ſad: and to ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked in their Apoſtacy from the truth, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity againſt it.

Are theſe the words of him, that delighteth not in the bloud of his bloudyeſt enemies, and gainſayers? when the Lord Jeſus ſendeth forth his ſervants to powre out bloudy vengeance upon Antichriſtian emiſſaries, and openeth the hearts &amp; mouthes of his Saints to praiſe him for thus judging (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.4,—7) Is this to proclaime a <hi>Magna-Charta</hi> of higheſt libertyes, even to his gainſayers, and to ſuch as joyn with his enemy Antichriſt?</p>

               <head>CHAP. 79. <hi>Touching the Modell of Church and civill Power, compoſed by Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>and the Miniſters of</hi> New-England, <hi>and ſent to the Church of</hi> Salem <hi>&amp;c. Examined (by the</hi> Diſcuſſer) <hi>and Anſwered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Title or Inſcription (which the Examiner ſetteth up of this Modell) holdeth forth to the world a double falſhood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Modell was compoſed by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and other Miniſters of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one falſhood. What other Miniſters of <hi>New-England</hi> did in it, themſelves know: But for Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> I know, that he was none of them that compoſed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Modell was ſent to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> if he meane, ſent by thoſe Miniſters (as the following words imply, for the confirmation of their Doctrine) that is another falſhood. The Miniſters themſelves, that compoſed the Modell, doe deny it; Howſoever the Modell came to <hi>Salem,</hi> the Miniſters ſay, it was not ſent by them. But ſee, when men are left of God, openly, and boldly to write againſt the truth in matter of Doctrin, how readily and freely, they can write and ſpeake falſhood in matter of fact?</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:160232:98"/>
               <p>It is therefore leſſe marvell, that in Anſwer to the preface of the Modell, he breaketh forth into ſuch vaſt hyperboles, <hi>That the Modell awakeneth</hi> Meſes <hi>from his unknowne Grave: and denyeth Jeſus yet to have ſeen the earth.</hi> A ſpeech as devoid of reaſon, as of truth. The obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawes doth not awaken <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his grave, nor is there any reaſon it ſhould. The validity of Lawes doth not (in reaſon) depend upon the life or reſurrection of the Lawgiver: the Examiner himſelfe (I ſuppoſe) would not doubt, but the Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> were of force to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was dead and buried before their entrance into the Land. Neither did their obſervation of them awaken <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his grave, but argued his Lawes to be in force as well after his death, as whilſt he was yet living. If it be ſaid, That Chriſt at his coming in the fleſh when he was buried himſelfe, buried alſo the Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> with him in his grave.</p>
               <p>Then the Examiner ſhould not have ſaid, that the Modell raiſed up <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his grave, but that it raiſed up Chriſt out of his grave.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid againe, the Examiner ſaith, It denyed Chriſt to have ſeen the earth, which was of as ill conſequence. Be it ſo: but yet ſtill, this maketh nothing to the raſing up of <hi>Moſes</hi> out of his grave.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer further, Neither doth it at all deny, Chriſt to have ſeen the earth. For Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law of <hi>Moſes, Mat.</hi> 5.17. Neither the Morall Law: for in the ſequele of that Chapter, he doth at large expound it, and eſtabliſh it:</p>
               <p>No, nor did he come to deſtroy the judiciall Lawes, ſuch of them as are of Morall equity. Or elſe, the Conſcience of the civill Magiſtrate could never doe any act of civill juſtice out of faith, becauſe he ſhould have no word of God to be the ground of his action, if the Lawes of judgement in the Old-Teſtament were abrogated, and none extant in the New. As for the exception, which the Examiner taketh againſt the Preface. It is as eaſily avoided, as Objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If (ſaith he) the civill Magiſtrate (even the higheſt) being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, be ſubject to Church-Cenſure, how can this ſtand with their common Tenent, that he muſt keepe the firſt Table, Reforme the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:160232:99"/>Church, be Judge and Governor in all cauſes, as well eccleſiaſticall as Civill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, how can a Magiſtrate both ſit on the Bench, and ſtand at the Bar of Chriſt Jeſus? Is it not as impoſſible, as to reconcile eaſt and weſt together? Yea, is not the Text in</hi> Iſa. 49, 23. Lamentably wreſted to prove both theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Reply.</label>
               </p>
               <p>One Anſwer may eaſily remove both Exceptions: And that one Text doth expreſly hold forth both theſe Points, which the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner conceiveth to be ſo irreconcilable.</p>
               <p>For if Princes be nurſing Fathers to the Church (as that Text ſpeaketh) then they are to provide, that the children of the Church be not nurſed with poiſon in ſtead of milke. And in ſo doing, they keepe the firſt Table. <hi>Reforme the Church, &amp; judge in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, If the the ſame Princes ſhall bow down to the Church with their faces towards the earth, and lick the duſt of her feet (as the ſame Text expreſſeth) then they being members of the Church, ſhall be ſubject alſo to Church-Cenſure. In one word, Princes ſit on the Bench over the Church in the offenſive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church: &amp; yet may themſelves (being members of the Church) be ſubject to Church-Cenſure in the offenſive Government of themſelves againſt the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Examiner himſelfe conteſſeth, that in ſeverall reſpects, <hi>He that is a governor may be alſo a Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here are ſeverall reſpects, to wit, ſeverall objects of Judicature; In the Mal-Adminiſtration of the Church, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſitteth as Judge, and Governor: in the Mal-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a Church-Member-Magiſtrate contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe rules of the Goſpel, he is ſubject to the power of Chriſt in the Church. If it be ſaid, nay rather, The Church is ſubject to the Magiſtrate in civill cauſes: and the Magiſtrate is ſubject to the Church in ſpirituall cauſes:</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That eaſeth not the difficulty, no more then the other. For ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate (a Church member) live in Inceſt, breake forth into murder, and notorious oppreſſion: theſe are all civill cauſes, belonging to the ſecond Table. If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſit as Judge and ſupreme Governor in this caſe, then muſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:160232:99"/>the Church tolerate him herein, to the diſhonour of the great Name of Chriſt, to the leavening of the Church, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his ſoule. If it be granted, that in ſuch a caſe though civill, the Church is bound to deale faithfully with the Magiſtrate, and not to ſuffer ſinne upon him: let the like power be granted to the Magiſtrate to deale faithfully with the Church in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious tranſgreſſions of the firſt Table, as is granted to the Church to deale with the Magiſtrate in the notorious tranſgreſſions of the ſecond Table, and the controverſie is ended.</p>
               <p>If any further matter be claimed in making the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, the Supreme Judge and Governor in all cauſes, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall, as civill, I doe not underſtand, that the Miniſters or Churches of Chriſt are called to acknowledge ſuch a meaning. Sure I am, the Interpretation of that high ſtile, which godly learned <hi>Reynolds</hi> made of it in the 10. Chap. of his Conference with <hi>Hart,</hi> It was accepted of the State in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And the ſame Interpretation (if no more be intended by that ſtile) doth well ſtand with our defence.</p>
               <p>But wherefore doe I put my Sicle into the Harveſt of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? my Brethren, who penned that Modell, are richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Chriſt with ability to defend it. I therefore leave it to them, whom it cheifly concerneth, to maintaine the Truth, which themſelves have witneſſed in that Modell.</p>
               <p>And the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf (the God of Truth) who came into the world, that he might beare witneſſe to the Truth, be pleaſed to beare witneſſe from Heaven to his owne Truth and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch a Letter to ſuch a purpoſe, I doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I wrote unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> about halfe a ſcore yeares agoe. But whether this printed Letter be a true Copie thereof, or no, I doe not know; for the Letter being ſent ſo long ſince, and no Copie of it (that I can finde) reſerved by me; I can own it no further then I finde the matter and ſtyle, expreſſing the judgement which I then had of his cauſe of Separation, and the affection I bare unto his perſon. And for ought I ſee, the Letter doth not unfitly expreſſe both.</p>
            <p>But how it came to be put in print, I cannot imagine. Sure I am it was without my privitie: and when I heard of it, it was to me unwelcome Newes, as knowing the truth, and weight of <hi>Plinies</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Aliud eſt ſcribere uni, aliud omnibus.</hi> There be who thinke it was publiſhed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelfe, or by ſome of his friends, who had the Copie from him. Which latter might be the more probable, becauſe himſelfe denieth the publiſhing of it: and it ſticketh in my mind that I received many yeares agoe, a refutation of it (in a brotherly and ingenuous way) from a ſtranger to me, but one (as I heare) well affected to him, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sabine Stareſmore.</hi> To whom I had long agoe returned an Anſwer, but that he did
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160232:101"/>not direct me where my Letter might find him. But I doe not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stareſmore,</hi> nor M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelfe to have publiſhed it; but rather ſome other (unadviſed) Chriſtian, who (having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a copie of the Letter, tooke more libertie, then God alloweth, to draw forth a private Admonition to publick notice in a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way.</p>
            <p>But howſoever it was, upon the publiſhing of this Letter, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> hath taken occaſion (as is obſerved by ſome who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Spirit of the man) firſt to riſe up againſt me (the meaneſt of many) in the examining and reſuting of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And then (as if one <hi>Mordecai</hi> were too ſmall a morſell) to ſtand forth againſt all the Churches, and Elders in <hi>New-England,</hi> in his <hi>Bloudy Tenent:</hi> And then (as if <hi>New-England</hi> were but an handfull) from thence to riſe up againſt the choiſeſt Ornaments of two populous Nations, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines, together with the reverend Brethren of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology: and above them all to addreſſe himſelfe (according to his high thoughts) to propound Quaeries of high concernment (as he calleth them) to the High and Honourable Court of Parliament. So a Bird of prey, affecting to ſoare aloft, getteth firſt upon the top of a molehill, and from thence taketh his riſe from Pale to Tree, till he have ſurmounted the higheſt Mountaines.</p>
            <p>In this apprehenſion of him they are the more confirmed, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcerned the like frame of Spirit in his former walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.

And then fell off from his Miniſtery, and then from all Church-fellowſhip, and then from his Baptiſme, (and was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe baptized againe) and then from the Lords Supper, and from all Ordinances of Chriſt diſpenſed in any Church-way, till God ſhall ſtirre up himſelfe, or ſome other new Apoſtles to recover, and reſtore all the Ordinances, and Churches of Chriſt out of the ruines of Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie.</p>

            <p>But for mine own part, whatſoever thoughts, others (who ſeeme to know him well) have conceived of his Spirit, and courſe in theſe things: yet I chooſe rather to leave all Judgement of him, to Him, who ſeeth, and ſearcheth the heart, and reines, and will one day bring every ſecret thing, yea the very thoughts, and intents of the ſonnes of men, unto righteous Judgement.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, ſeeing the Tree is knowne by his fruits, I doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend, that he knowing the Spirit breatheth where he pleaſeth, and conceiving himſelfe to have received a clearer illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and apprehenſion of the eſtate of Chriſts Kingdome, and of the purity of holy Communion, then all Chriſtendome (yea even Chriſtendome it ſelfe is an unſavoury word to him) he therefore taketh it to be his duty, to give publique advertiſement, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to all men, whether of meaner note, (ſuch as my ſelfe) or of more publique note, and place, of the corruptions of Religion, which himſelfe obſerveth in their judgement, and practice. Neither would I deny, <hi>but that</hi> (to uſe his own words) <hi>God ſometimes ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up one Elijah againſt eight hundred of Baals Prieſts, one Micajah againſt foure hundred of Ahabs Prophets; one Athanaſius againſt many hundreths of Arrian Biſhops; one John Hus againſt the whole Councell of Conſtance; Luther and the two witneſſes againſt many thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I durſt not neglect, much leſſe deſpiſe any advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him alone againſt ſo many; provided that the word of the Lord be found in his mouth, or pen. I come therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and weigh what he ſaith to my ſelfe, without prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and (I hope) without partiality to my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>In his Epiſtle to the Reader, before his Anſwer to my Letter, he utterly miſconſtrueth the ground and ſcope, whether of this Letter, or of any other Letters of mine to him, <hi>As if I wrote upon occaſion of the griefe, which ſome friends conceived, That ſuch an one as himſelfe (publickly acknowledged to be godly, and dearely beloved) ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the mercy of an howling Wilderneſſe, in froſt and ſnow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that my intent in writing was, to take off the edge of Cenſure from my ſelfe, by profeſſing in ſpeech, and writing, That I was no procurer of his ſorrowes,</hi> &amp;c. In which few lines, foure things preſent themſelves, which if they be cleared, may cleare both his miſtake of himſelfe, and his cauſe, and together therewith the innocency of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he ſpeaketh of himſelfe as one publickly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160232:102"/>to be godly and dearely beloved, I did never perceive juſt ground for ſuch publick acknowledgement. For before my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>New-England,</hi> the godly-wiſe, and vigilant Ruling-Elder of <hi>Plymouth</hi> (aged M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bruiſter</hi>) had warned the whole Church of the danger of his ſpirit, which moved the better part of the Church, to be glad of his removall from them into the Bay. And in the Bay not long before my coming, he began to oppoſe the Kings Patent with much vehemency, (as he had done at <hi>Plymouth</hi> before;) which made the Magiſtrates to feare, they ſhould have more to doe with him, then with a man publickly acknowledged to be godly, and dearely beloved.</p>
            <p>Soone after, when upon hearing of ſome Epiſcopall, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant practiſes againſt the Countrey, the Magiſtrates, and whole generall Court thought meet to take a tryall of the fidelity of the people (not by impoſing upon them, but) by offering to them an Oath of Fidelitie, That in caſe any ſhould refuſe, they might not betruſt them with place of publick Command; He vehemently withſtood it, partly becauſe it was Chriſts Prerogative to have his Office eſtabliſhed by Oath; partly, becauſe an Oath was a part of Gods worſhip, and many of the people being carnall (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) it was not meet to put upon them an Oath, which was an act of Gods worſhip. Upon ſuch, and the like diſturbances to the Civill Peace (for upon this ſundry refuſed the Oath, and upon their refuſall the Magiſtrates could not diſcerne how the people ſtood affected to the publick Safety) therefore, both the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and ſundry Elders (though I doe not remember my ſelfe to be one) adviſed the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> not to proceed to chooſe him (as they were then about to doe) unto office in the Church. Yea and in <hi>Salem</hi> (though many of the Members were taken with him) ſome judicious amongſt them told me, they could not chooſe him to office, becauſe they found him to be (contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles rule) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſelfe-pleaſing, ſelfe-full, or (as it is tranſlated) ſelfe-willed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.7. Nevertheleſſe, the major part of the Church made choice of him. Soone after the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> made ſuit to the Court, for a parcell of Land, which lay commodious for them: But the Court delayed to grant their requeſt, becauſe the Church had refuſed to hearken to their motion, in forbearing the choice of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams.</hi> Which ſo much incenſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> that he cauſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160232:102"/>the Church to joyne with him, in writing Letters of Admonition to all the Churches, whereof any of the Magiſtrates were members, to admoniſh their Magiſtrates of their breach of the rule of Juſtice, in not granting their Petition. Which following upon all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſturbances raiſed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> it ſtill aggravated the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer jealouſies, which generally, the judicious ſort of Chriſtians had conceived of his ſelfe-conceited, and unquiet, and unlambelike frame of his Spirit: So that from firſt to laſt of my knowledge of him here, I cannot ſee, nor ſay, what ground he had of ſuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, as he giveth of himſelfe, as of one <hi>publickly acknowledged to be godly, and dearely beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When he maketh it an occaſion of my excuſe of my ſelfe, (from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an hand in his ſufferings) that ſome friends were much grieved that ſuch an one ſhould be expoſed to ſuch ſufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do beleeve indeed, that not ſome friends onely, but many were grieved at the unmoveable ſtiffneſſe, and headineſſe of his Spirit, that expoſed him to ſuch ſufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he doth not well to ſay, that ſome friends were grieved, that one ſo publickly acknowledged, ſhould be expoſed to ſuch ſufferings;</hi> thereby to intimate as if his ſufferings were greater then his deſervings. For neither might ſuch friends be truely called his friends; nor was their judgement of any weight in his cauſe. For they cleaved to him, and his cauſe, not out of judicious charity, but out of an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing levity, taken with every wind of new Doctrine: which ſoone after appeared. For within a ſhort time, when his new Notions grew ſtale to them, they ſeparated from him, (as he from them) and began to liſten after a more prodigious Minter of exorbitant novelties, (the very dregs of Familiſme) held forth by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Gorton</hi> at firſt arrived in our Bay, and continued a while in our Towne, till a reverend Miniſter in <hi>London,</hi> (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Walker</hi>) ſent over Directions to ſome friends, to demand an 100.<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. debt of him, which he having borrowed of a Citizen, the Citizen bequeathed it to ſome good uſe, whereof M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Walker</hi> was called to ſome Truſt. But then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gorton</hi> departed out of this Juriſdiction to <hi>Plymouth:</hi> and there beginning to ſpread ſome of his Opinions, to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church, and fearing diſturbance to himſelfe, he came to <hi>Roade-Iſland;</hi> and there raiſing ſome ſeditious diſturbance againſt the Magiſtrates, he met with publick correction. From thence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160232:103"/>therefore he went to <hi>Providence,</hi> the place where M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> (and thoſe ſome friends he ſpake of) ſat downe. But thoſe friends of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> were ſoone taken with that greater Light, which they conceived was held forth by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gorton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What kind of light that was came to our view upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: One or two of the <hi>Indian-Sagamores,</hi> who lived neare <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> came over into the Bay, to offer the ſubjection of themſelves, and their people, to the Government of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> hoping by this meanes to avoyde the oppreſſion of the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> (their potent Neighbours) as alſo of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gortons</hi> company, who took their lands from them. Afterwards thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> complaining to our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of ſome further injury done to them by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gortons</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; our Court ſent over to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gortons</hi> company, requiring ſome of them to come over, and ſhew what right they had to thoſe lands, which they had taken from the <hi>Indians,</hi> their Subjects. He and his company in ſtead of coming, or ſending any to cleare their Right, ſent two Books written by ſome of themſelves, full of ſundry here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and malignant blaſphemies, againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> againſt his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Miniſters, Sacraments, Cenſures, and Magiſtrates: yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all offered that if this Court would ſend their Agents over unto them, they would cleare their Right to the Land, which they took from the <hi>Indians.</hi> The Court therefore ſent over ſome, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Treat with them; and becauſe <hi>Gortons</hi> company had threatened the former Meſſengers with the offer of ſome violence, they therefore ſent as many armed men with theſe, as might ſecure their Agents from injury: And in caſe they refuſed to ſhew the right, and equitie of their cauſe, then to bring ſome of the principall of them, by ſtrong hand, to cleare it here. When hither they were come, (not to digreſſe to another Story) <hi>Gorton,</hi> deſiring libertie to ſpeak his minde freely, held it forth (as the minde of himſelfe, and his company,) (whereof thoſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his friends were no ſmall part;) <hi>That Chriſt was Incarnate when Adam was made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods Image: For God had but one Image, and that Image was Chriſt. And this making of Adam in that Image, was the exinanition of Chriſt.</hi> But when it was objected, that that exinanition of Chriſt was unto life in <hi>Adam,</hi> but Chriſt was to ſuffer exinanition unto death: He anſwered; <hi>That Chriſt dyed when the Image of God dyed: and the Image of God dyed in Adams fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:160232:103"/>
            <p>But when it was further objected, That Chriſts death was the Price and Purchaſe of our Redemption; but the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was not the Price of our Redemption, but the cauſe of our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſtopped, and would neither proceed to cleare his minde further, nor by any meanes be perſwaded to revoke that helliſh blaſphemy. Theſe, and many ſuch like Tenents were vented by him, and his company: and this company was made up of thoſe friends of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> who (as he ſaith) were grieved at his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall to the mercy of the Wilderneſſe. Which I thought meet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, leſt any ſhould thinke that his ſufferings (conſidering the cauſes of them) were grievous or offenſive to godly mindes.</p>
            <p>Where by the way, a ſincere hearted humble Chriſtian may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcerne the vaſt difference between the ſpirit of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> and of <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, in relating their ſufferings by way of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: <hi>John</hi> was a beloved Diſciple, yea (by way of eminency) the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved: and He, for the teſtimony of Jeſus, was baniſhed by the bloudy Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> a deſolate Wilderneſſe, deſtitute (for the moſt part) of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: yet he maketh no expreſſe mention of his Baniſhment, nor of the howling Wilderneſſe, nor of froſt, and ſnow, and ſuch winter miſeries: <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I was in the Iſle of Patmos for the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> being called by a weak man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in Chriſt, he aggravateth the baniſhment of ſuch an one as himſelfe, by all the ſad exaggerations, which wit and words could well paint it out withall; to wit, <hi>That he was, onely for the holy Truth of Chriſt Jeſus, denied the common ayre to breath in, and a civill cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the ſame common earth, yea and without mercy, and humane compaſſion expoſed to winter miſeries in an howling Wilderneſſe, in froſt, and ſnow, and that amongst Barbarians.</hi> So deeply affected the ſonnes of men can be in deſcribing their own ſufferings for themſelves, and their own wayes, above what the children of God be in their farre greater ſufferings for the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What cauſes moved the Magiſtrates ſo to proceed againſt him at that time, is fully declared by another faithfull and diligent hand, in another Treatiſe of that matter.</p>
            <p>But whereas he ſaith, <hi>He was expoſed to the mercies of an howling Wilderneſſe in froſt and ſnow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Sentence of his Baniſhment out of the Patent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:160232:104"/>was pronounced againſt him in the Court before winter; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite was given him to tarry certain weeks (ſix or more) to prepare for his journey.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, ſome of his friends went to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himſelfe before hand, to make proviſion of houſing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries for him againſt his coming; otherwiſe he might have choſen to have gone either Southward to his acquaintance at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> or Eaſtward to <hi>Paſcatoque,</hi> or <hi>Aganimticus.</hi> And then the wilderneſſe had been as no wilderneſſe, (at leaſt, no howling wilderneſſe) where men ſit downe under warme and dry Roofes, ſheltred from the annoyance of froſt, and ſnow, and other winter hardſhips.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When he ſaith, <hi>That my ſelfe profeſt in ſpeech and writing, that I was no procurer of his ſorrowes.</hi> I doe not beleeve that I made any ſuch profeſſion at all, either in ſpeech, or writing. For it was my ſerious intendment, (if it had been the will of God to breath in ſuch weake meanes for ſuch an end) to have procured his unfained godly ſorrow for his Errours in Judgement, and for his offenſive diſturbances of Churches, and Common-wealth. But this is that which I have profeſſed, That I had no hand in procuring, or ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sentence of his Baniſhment. And that not for the cauſe, which he noteth in his margent, as if I had ſome reluctancy in my ſelfe, concerning the way of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>For 1. I did never doubt, that the way of perſecution, (truly ſo called) that is, the affliction of others for righteouſneſſe ſake, was utterly unlawfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I did never beleeve, that the ſentence paſſed againſt him was an act of Perſecution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor did I ever ſee cauſe to doubt, but that in ſome caſes, (ſuch as this of his was,) Baniſhment is a lawfull, and juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: if it be in proper ſpeech a puniſhment at all in ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as this is, where the Juriſdiction (whence a man is baniſhed) is but ſmall, and the Countrey round about it, large, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: where a man may make his choice of variety of more pleaſant, and profitable ſeats, then he leaveth behinde him. In which reſpect, Baniſhment in this Countrey, is not counted ſo much a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as an enlargement, where a man doth not ſo much looſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill comforts, as change them. And as for ſpirituall liberties, (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:160232:104"/>of Church Ordinances) they were a burden and bondage to his ſpirit here: And therefore he caſt them off, before they left him; neither doth he to this day, look at it as a way of God, for any Chriſtian man to look after the Ordinances of God in a Church-eſtate at all; As conceiving that the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt hath ſo farre corrupted all, that there can be no recovery out of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, till Chriſt ſhall ſend forth new Apoſtles to plant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches anew.</p>
            <p>But as for the true cauſe why I medled not in his civill Cenſure, it was, chiefly becauſe Civill Cenſures belong unto another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then that which we are called to adminiſter: (Civill Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not the weapons of our warfare:) and partly alſo becauſe I was carried (as ſtill I am) with a compaſſion of his Perſon, and likewiſe of his wife, (a woman as then, of a meek and modeſt ſpirit) who a long time ſuffered in ſpirit, (as I was informed) for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive courſe: which occaſioned him for a ſeaſon to withdraw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in ſpirituall duties, even from her alſo, till at length he drew her to partake with him in the errour of his way.</p>
            <p>But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That in Letters paſt between him, and me, he proved, and expreſt, that if he had periſhed in that ſorrowfull win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flight, onely the bloud of Chriſt could have waſhed me from the guilt of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That he did expreſſe ſuch a thing in ſome Letters to me, as I doe not remember it, ſo neither will I deny it: but that he proved it, I may as ſafely deny it, as he boldly affirme it. Could he then have given any ſuch proofes, doubtleſſe he would not have concealed them now, when he undertaketh to cleare to the world the pretended innocency of himſelfe, and the ſuppoſed iniquitie of his ſuppoſed Perſecutors. How precious the bloud of Chriſt is to me, and how needfull (I bleſſe the Lord) my ſoule knoweth: but that I needed it to waſh away the guilt of any injurious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the bloud of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> (I ſpeake it in holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) I never diſcerned it to this day. The proofes which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in the ſequell for my hand in his Baniſhment, I ſhall (God willing) cleare them anon in due place. Meane while, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I made to him concerning the ſame in other Letters, he wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealeth: but contenteth himſelfe to tell us, that my finall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was; <hi>That had he periſhed in his flight, his bloud had been upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:160232:105"/>his own head: It was his ſinne to procure it, and his ſorrow to ſuffer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this was my finall Anſwer, it ſeemeth I gave him other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Anſwers: what they were I have now forgotten; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, had they been inſufficient, or impertinent, I ſhould have heard of them.</p>
            <p>But what is amiſſe in this finall Anſwer? The margent noteth it, "<hi>as an unmercifull ſpeech, of a mercifull man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when it ſhall pleaſe the Father of mercies of ſoften the heart of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> and to give him an heart, and eare to hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wholeſome Counſell of his true friends, he will at length ſee the ſpeech was truly mercifull, as well as the man that ſpake it. <hi>When a Fountaine is opened to Hieruſalem for ſinne, and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> the Prophets who have deceived the people ſhall at length ſee, and acknowledge their errour, and being demanded the cauſe of the wounds in their hands, They ſhall anſwer (each of them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>thus was I wounded in the houſe of my Friends,</hi> Zach. 13.1. with verſes 4, 5, 6. An heart ſoftened with the Bloud of Chriſt, will judge the wounds of his friends faithfull, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.6. I meane, ſuch reproofes for ſinne, which though they may ſeeme to wound, yet wound to heale. <hi>David</hi> thought ſuch ſmiting to be a kindneſſe, yea an excellent Oyle, which doth not breake the head, but heale the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more in his Epiſtle to the Reader, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for Anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It cannot now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be juſtly offenſive, that finding this Letter publick, (by whoſe procurement I know not) I now preſent to publick view my formerly intended Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It had not been offenſive to me, that he did preſent his Anſwer to publick view, if he found my Letter publick, without his own, or his friends procurement: eſpecially if his Anſwer had been returned in words of truth, and faithfulneſſe. Which how farre they fall ſhort of, I hope (by the help of Chriſt) will appeare in the ſequell.</p>
            <p>Meane while, I feare it is juſtly offenſive to the Spirit of Grace, and Love, That whereas he judged me to allow my ſelfe, and others, to reſt ſecurely in the Doctrine, and Practiſe of bloudy Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all this while (even for the ſpace of nine or ten yeares) he ſuffered me to ſleep ſo long ſo quietly under the guilt of ſuch a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:160232:105"/>crying ſinne. Nay, it may ſeeme by his own words, if he had not found my Letter publick, it may be doubted whether ever I ſhould have heard any further word from him hereabouts, at all. If I had been eſteemed as a Brother, ſinne ſhould not have been ſuffered to lie ſo long upon a Brother, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. If an enemy, yet the very Oxe or Aſſe of an enemy, is not to be ſuffered to lye ſo long grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under his burden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.4.</p>
            <p>But when he addeth in the next ſentence; <hi>That he rejoyceth in the goodneſſe, and wiſedome of him, who is the Father of lights, and mercies, in ordering the ſeaſon of his own preſent opportunitie of Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe we on the contrary have cauſe to admire, and adore the wiſdome, and dreadfull Juſtice of God herein, That ſeeing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> hath been now as a branch cut off from the Church of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> theſe many yeares, he ſhould bring forth no ſpirituall good fruits in due ſeaſon: and that which he bringeth forth now at the laſt is bitter, and wild fruit: and that in ſuch a ſeaſon, when the Spirit of Error is let looſe to deceive ſo many thouſand ſoules of our Engliſh Nation: So that now their hearts are become as Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ready to catch and kindle at every ſparke of falſe light. Even ſo, O Father, becauſe thy good pleaſure is ſuch, to let looſe this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error in the mouth of this Backſlider, in the very houre and power of darkneſſe: for theſe are the dayes of vengeance; when the Antinomians deny the whole Law; the Anti-Sabbatarians deny the Morality of the fourth Commandement; the Papiſts deny the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part of the ſecond Commandement. It is a wofull opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that God hath left M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to, now to ſtep in, and deny the Affirmative part of it alſo, (as the Papiſts doe the Negative) and ſo He and the Papiſts to combine together to evacuate the whole ſecond Commandement altogether. For, take away (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> doth) all Inſtituted worſhip of God, as Churches, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, Members, publick Miniſtery of the Word, Covenant, Seales of the Covenant, (Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper) the Cenſures of the Church, and the like, what is then left of all the Inſtitutions, and Ordinances of God, which the Lord eſtabliſhed in the ſecond Commandement, againſt the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, Images, and Inventions of men in his worſhip? But it is an holy wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe of the Lord, that he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the Communion with the Churches of the Saints, ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:160232:106"/>joyne in communion with the enemies of the Saints, even Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians; and that in ſuch a worke, as to blot out and extinguiſh that holy ſecond Commandement of the Law: The violating whereof kindleth the jealouſie of the moſt High: and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof would have opened a doore of mercy to a thouſand Generations! It is no vaine word of our Saviour, <hi>He that ſhall breake one of the leaſt Commandements, and ſhall Teach men ſo to doe, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This advice would I ſhut up this Point withall, (if I had any hope of an open eare in him to heare it) he that ſeparateth from all Churches, and all Ordinances, let him at laſt ſeparate alſo from himſelfe: and ſo he ſhall then be better able to diſcerne the way to returne againe unto holy Communion with the Lord, and his people.</p>
            <p>Let me conclude this Preface with this Advertiſement to the Reader, who may perhaps marvell, that I now (ſo much againſt my uſuall cuſtome) ſhould lay open the nakedneſſe of another to publick view. I bleſſe the Lord, I am not ignorant, That love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of offences: and that the Diſciples of Chriſt, when they are reviled are taught to Bleſſe. And therefore were the caſe meerely mine own, and all the reproaches and ſlanders caſt upon my ſelfe, had terminated in my ſelfe, I ſhould have been as a deafe man, and as a dumb man that openeth not his lips. But when through my ſides, not onely ſo many Elders, and Churches in this Countrey, who had as much (or more) influence into his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as my ſelfe, (and yet none of us any further influence, then by private, and publick conviction of himſelfe, and of the demerit of his way;) yea when Courts of Juſtice ſuffer for Juſtice ſake: yea further, when the Truth and Righteouſneſſe of God alſo ſuffer for inflicting juſt recompence of reward upon the diſturbers of Civill and ſacred Truth, and Peace: and under pretence of maintaining Liberty of Conſcience, Purity of Conſcience is violated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: In ſuch a caſe as this, juſt it is, and equall, rather that the name of an evill-worker ſhould juſtly ſuffer, then that the name of God called upon Judgement ſeats, upon the Churches of Chriſt, and upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſhould unjuſtly ſuffer for his ſake.</p>

               <head>To his CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>MY Letter to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> (which he undertaketh to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Anſwer) began (it ſeemeth) with this Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of him, <hi>Beloved in Chriſt.</hi> For I conſidered, he had been not onely a member, but an Officer of the Church at <hi>Salem:</hi> and though from thence he was then Excommunicate; yet I took the Apoſtles Commandement for a Rule, <hi>Account him not as an enemy, but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him as a Brother,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.14. If a Brother of the Church, (though caſt out of the Church, yet not caſt out of Chriſt) then in Chriſt, at leaſt in judgement of charity. And if in Chriſt (though but in judgement of charity, yet) in charity to be Beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams) how can it be well-pleaſing to Chriſt, that one beloved in Chriſt, ſhould be ſo afflicted, and perſecuted by himſelfe, and others, (for ſuch cauſes) as to be denyed the common ayre to breath in, and a civill cohabitation upon the ſame common earth, yea and alſo without mercy, and humane compaſſion, be expoſed to winter miſeries in an howling Wilderneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> may be Judge in his own cauſe, himſelfe hath been perſecuted without mercy, and without humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: And which the more concerneth my ſelfe to enquire into, he hath been ſo perſecuted by me, and ſome others; but chiefly (it ſhould ſeeme) by me; for I onely am charged herewith by name: and thoſe others, who ever they were, are not ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, much leſſe expreſly named. But ſuch Prieſts, and Perſons, as be thus partiall in the Law, the Holy Ghoſt threatneth to make them baſe, and contemptible in the eyes of all the People, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.9. Which the Lord give him to foreſee, and feare, that he may timely prevent ſuch a Judgement.</p>
               <p>But to weigh his words particularly: Perſecution is the affliction of another for Righteouſneſſe ſake. Now two things it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to prove, to make good his charge. 1. That the cauſe for which he ſuffered, was a cauſe of Righteouſneſſe. 2. That he ſuffered this Perſecution, which he complaineth of, by me. And to make this latter charge good in ſuch manner as he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it upon me, it were further requiſite that he ſhould prove two things more. 1. That my ſelfe was the principall mover and actor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:160232:107"/>in this his Perſecution, (for I onely am ſingled out by name;) 2. That this hath been evidenced to him by two, or three witneſſes at leaſt, if he account me for an Elder of a Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. But whether he account me for an Elder, or no Elder, (I claime no priviledge of Office;) yet I require attendance to an eternall Law of morall Righteouſneſſe; <hi>One witneſſe ſhall not riſe up againſt a man for any Iniquity, or for any ſinne: at the mouth of two witneſſes, or at the mouth of three witneſſes, ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Deut. 15.15. But on the contrary, if it doe appeare, that the cauſe for which he ſuffered was not for Righteouſneſſe ſake: and that the affliction which he did ſuffer was not put upon him by me at all much leſſe in any eminent, and ſingular manner, then it will behoove M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> in Conſcience to underſtand, that himſelfe is the Perſecutor, as of other ſervants of God, ſo of my ſelfe eſpecially. For it is a caſe judged by the Holy Ghoſt, that he who mocketh, or reproacheth any of the leaſt of Chriſts little ones, for walking in his way, he is a Perſecutor, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. It hath been the lot of the faithfull of old to be tryed by cruell mockings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. If a man be publickly accuſed to the world as a Perſecutor, in caſe the accuſation be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true, Perſecution is a cruell, and crying ſinne: but if it be not proved, nor true, the falſe accuſation is a grievous Perſecution, even a cruell mocking. But I ſhall referre the tryall of his accuſation to the place himſelfe appointed, where he giveth Inſtance of the cauſe of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Meane while, let him ſuſpend his Marginall note, <hi>That it is a monſtrous Paradox, that Gods children ſhould Perſecute Gods children, and they that hope to live eternally with Chriſt Jeſus in Heaven, ſhould not ſuffer each other to live in this common ayre together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though Gods children may not perſecute Gods children, nor wicked men neither, for well-doing: yet if the children of God be found to walke in the way of the wicked, their ſinne is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they ſinne againſt greater light, and grace: and their Brethren (in Place) may juſtly afflict them for it: to deprive them, in ſome caſes, not onely of the common ayre of the Countrey by baniſhment, but even of the common ayre of the world by death: &amp; yet hope to live eternally with them in the Heavens with Chriſt Jeſus. Yea what if a child of God were infected with a plague-ſore, or ſome other contagious diſeaſe, may not their Brethren exclude
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:160232:107"/>them the common ayre, both of their religious, and Civill Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and yet hope to live eternally with them in the Heavens? Truely there be ſome unſound, and corrupt opinions, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (and that of him too) which are more infectious, and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, then any plague-ſore.</p>
               <p>That other Marginall note of his, <hi>(What Chriſt Perſecute Chriſt in New-England?)</hi> calleth for another Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not perſecute Chriſt in <hi>New-England:</hi> For Chriſt doth not perſecute any at all, (to ſpeake in the proper ſence of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;) much leſſe doth Chriſt perſecute Chriſt. For though Chriſt may and doth afflict his own members; yet he doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict (much leſſe perſecute) Chriſt in them, but that which is left of old <hi>Adam</hi> in them, or that which is found of the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in them. For even Satan may fill the heart of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. Yea breathe and act in an Elect Apoſtle, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.22, 23. And then the Lord Jeſus may afflict in his members, that which he ſeeth in them nor of his own.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds, and asks further, (<hi>Since</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Cotton <hi>expecteth farre greater light then yet ſhineth) whether upon the ſame grounds, and practiſe, if Chriſt Jeſus in any of his ſervants ſhall be pleaſed to hold forth a farther light, ſhall he himſelfe find the mercy, and humanitie of a Civill, and temporall life, and being with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greateſt light that I expect is not above the Word, much leſſe againſt it: nor is it deſtructive to the Church, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, eſtabliſhed according to the Word, but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of them in the way of the word. If therefore Chriſt Jeſus ſhall come in any of his ſervants, holding forth a further light to us, we truſt, that he that offereth us light, will give us (as hitherto he hath done) eyes to ſee it, and hearts to follow it. Light is diſcernable (through the Grace of the Father of Lights) by the children of light: The Spirit of the Prophets is diſcerned, and judged by the Prophets: Wiſdome is juſt fied of her Children: When Judgement returneth to Righteouſneſſe, all the upright in heart ſhall follow it: The Sheep of Chriſt that ſee his face, will ſee his Light, and heare his voyce: his Spirit of Truth will lead them into all truth. And yet becauſe we all know in part, and Prophecy in part, we are taught of God in meekneſſe of wiſdome to inſtruct one another, (till light of Inſtruction be obſtinately rejected;) and to ſuffer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:160232:108"/>one another in differences of weakneſſe, till weakneſſe prove wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and will not ſuffer Truth to live in Peace.</p>
               <p>But what is all this to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams? Hath he therefore not found the mercy, and humanity of Civill, and temporall life, and being amongst us, becauſe Chriſt Jeſus held forth by him a further light unto us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it ſhould ſeeme, or elſe his Quaere is nothing to the purpoſe; ſurely if it be a further light which is held forth by him, it is ſuch a tranſcendent light, as putteth out all other lights in the world beſides: as (they ſay) <hi>Majus lumen extinguit minus.</hi> The Churches of Chriſt have been wont to be counted lights, the Miniſtery, lights, the Sacraments, and Cenſures, lights. But this new light held forth by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> hath put out all theſe lights, yea and all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their ſhining forth againe, till the Reſtitution of new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And yet if he had held forth any light from the word of light to manifeſt this great new light to us, truly I hope the Lord would give us hearts, not to ſhut our eyes againſt the light, but to follow the Lambe whitherſoever he goeth, and to follow the light of his word whitherſoever it leadeth us. Chriſtian Magiſtrates, they alſo have been wonted to be counted the light of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and Oaths likewiſe have been thought to give light to diſcerne the end of all Controverſies: But by this new light, we may not accept from the Patents of Princes any light or direction where to ſit downe, with their warrant, and leave, in forreine Plantations: Neither may we make uſe of the light of Oaths between Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and people, to diſcerne of the fidelity and conſtancy of the one to the other in times of danger. Where then ſhall his Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Note appeare?</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>expecting more light, muſt (according to his way of Perſecution) Perſecute Chriſt Jeſus, if he bring it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> hold me ſo farre forſaken of common ſence, as to fruſtrate, and deſtroy mine own expectations? If I expect more light, muſt I (according to mine own way) needs Perſecute him that brings it, yea perſecute Chriſt himſelfe, if he bring it? But thus when a mans head runneth round, he thinketh all the Houſe runneth round about him.</p>
               <p>But what is my way of Perſecution, according to which, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting more light, muſt needs perſecute him that brings it? It is but a few dayes agoe, ſince there came to my hand a book, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:160232:108"/>(as is ſaid) by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> and entituled, <hi>The Bloudy Tenent.</hi> In which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> (without my privity) publiſhed a private Letter of mine, and therewith a Confutation of it, touching Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for cauſe of Conſcience. In my ſtating of that Queſtion, (which he relateth in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page of that Book) he declareth my Judgement to be ſo farre from perſecuting any for cauſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he layeth it downe for my firſt Concluſion; <hi>That it is not lawfull to perſecute any for Conſcience ſake rightly informed [that is to ſay, bringing more, and true light.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For an erroneous and blind Conſcience, (even in fundamentall, and weighty Points) it is not lawfull to perſecute any, till after Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition once or twice, according to the Apoſtles direction,</hi> Tit. 3.10, 11. <hi>That ſo ſuch a man being convinced of the dangerous error of his way; if he ſtill perſiſt (being condemned of himſelfe,</hi> ver. 11.) <hi>it may appeare, he is not perſecuted for Cauſe of Conſcience, but for ſinning againſt his own Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In things of leſſe moment, whether Points of Doctrine or worſhip, if a man hold them forth in a ſpirit of Chriſtian meekneſſe and love, (though with zeale and conſtancy) he is not to be perſecuted, but tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till God may be pleaſed to manifeſt his Truth to him,</hi> Phil. 3.17. Rom. 14.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>But if a man hold forth or profeſſe any error, or falſe way, with a boyſterous, and arrogant ſpirit, to the diſturbance of Civill Peace, he may juſtly be puniſhed according to the meaſure of the diſturbance cauſed by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that way of Perſecution which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> expreſſeth to be mine. In all which I durſt appeale to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his own Conſcience, (were it not Leavened with over-deepe prejudice) whether in all this way there be any creviſe opening a doore for the Perſecution of Chriſt himſelfe bringing further light?</p>
               <p>Let no man take it amiſſe, that (in the Parentheſis) I intimate, the Conſcience of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> in this caſe to be leavened with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch prejudice. For if extreme prejudice were not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in him in this caſe, I ſhould ſtand amazed how a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could out of ſuch Concluſions make up this Inference, which he gives in the Title of the Chapt. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>That I doe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly maintaine Perſecution for Cauſe of Conſcience.</hi> I that doe expreſly, profeſſedly deny Perſecution of any, even of Hereticks, unleſſe it be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:160232:109"/>when they come to perſiſt in hereſie, after conviction, againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: how can I be ſaid to maintaine Perſecution for Cauſe of Conſcience? But oh the wofull perverſeneſſe and blindneſſe of a Conſcience, when it is left of God, to be ſo farre tranſported with prejudice, as to judge a Cauſe of Conſcience, and a cauſe againſt Conſcience to be all one.</p>
               <p>For the ſhutting up of his Chapter, he is pleaſed to Comment upon a phraſe in my Letter, wherein I ſtyled my ſelfe a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed lips. And he doth acknowledge it to be <hi>an holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an heavenly Spirit, to make an ingenuous, and true acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of an uncircumciſed lip. Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that diſcerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which God graciouſly vouchſafeth to them that tremble at his Word, ſhall finde, that not onely the will-worſhips of men may be painted, and varniſhed over with the glittering ſhew of Humilitie,</hi> Coloſ. 2. <hi>but even Gods deareſt ſervants (eminent for humility, and meekneſſe) may yet be troubled with a ſwelling of ſpirituall pride, out of the very ſence of their humilitie, &amp;c. Humilitie is never in ſeaſon to ſet up ſuperſtition, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Gods children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I could intreat ſome or other of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (whoſe words may finde better acceptance with him, then mine doe) to perſwade him, not to attribute too much to his own Spirit of diſcerning; which though he truely ſaith, God doth vouchſafe to them that tremble at his word: yet I never read, nor heard, that God did vouchſafe a Spirit of diſcerning to any that are ſo farre from trembling at the word, that they doe not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to heare the word from the mouth of ſo many thouſand faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the Goſpel. As for me, I deſire not to neglect any word from the mouth of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> (upon what pretence ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken) that putteth me in minde of ſpirituall pride, ariſing out of the very ſence of humilitie. Such ſmiting ſhall not breake my head.</p>
               <p>But when he concludeth with this Aphoriſme; <hi>Humilitie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſeaſon to ſet up ſuperſtition, or to perſecute Gods children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire it may be conſidered, what is Superſtition? what is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? and whether my Letter unto him tended to ſet up the one, or to ſet forward the other?</p>
               <p>Superſtition is properly <hi>cultus ſupra ſtatutum,</hi> which I ſpeake not from the Etymology of the word, (for I know Latiniſts doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:160232:109"/>derive it) but from the nature of the thing. And what is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? It hath been anſwered above, the affliction of any for their Righteouſneſſe ſake. If it appeare in the ſequele, that my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tended either to ſet up any worſhip of God, which he hath not appointed, or to afflict any for their Righteouſneſſe ſake, then I will confeſſe it tended to ſet up Superſtition, and Perſecution: And the humilitie which he acknowledgeth to be expreſſed in my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall acknowledge to be out of ſeaſon: Meane while, <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manti incumbit Probatio.</hi>

               <p>His ſecond Chapter is ſpent in anſwering to a double charge, which he ſaith, he obſerveth, I laid againſt him. Though in very Truth, I layd neither of them downe as charges againſt him, but as diſcharges to my ſelfe from expecting that <hi>He ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to hearken to my voyce, who had refuſed to hearken both to the voyce of the body of the whole Church of Salem</hi> (whereof he was a member) <hi>and to the voyces of ſo many Elders, and brethren of other Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe I did charge him with a double ſinne in refuſing to hearken to this double voyce, (though I did not ſay it was a ſinne:) how doth he diſcharge himſelfe? <hi>For neglect of the former, he excuſeth himſelfe by the charge of his Office, which lay upon him, on a Faſt-day to diſcover to them eleven publick ſinnes, as cauſes of the preſent, and publick calamities. Which moſt of the Church ſeemed at firſt to aſſent unto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till afterwards, the greater part of the Church (whether for feare of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, or otherwiſe) was ſwayed, and bowed to practiſe ſuch things, which with ſighes and groanes many of them mourned under.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But will this indeed diſcharge an Elder of the Church before the Lord, from coming into the preſence of the Church, when they ſend for him, becauſe the greater part of them, <hi>are bowed, and ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for feare of Perſecution, to ſlip, and ſlide, and to ſay and practiſe that, which with ſighes and groanes they mourned under?</hi> Why then, if the Wolfe come, and ſcatter the ſheepe, and they ſlip out of the way, let the Shepheard fly, and leave them; that the word of the Lord Jeſus might be fulfilled; <hi>He that is an Hireling, and not the Shepheard,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:160232:110"/>whoſe own the ſheepe are not, he ſeeth the Wolfe coming, and leaveth the ſheepe, and fleeth, and the Wolfe catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheepe, Joh.</hi> 10.12.</p>
               <p>Or will it goe for currant Doctrine before the Lord, that if the greater part of a Church fall (through feare, or otherwiſe) into ſinne, and ſuch a ſinne, which they mourne under with ſighes, and groanes, and which in it ſelfe is not hainous, that then they doe <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> ceaſe to be a Church, and utterly to be caſt out? Why then let the Covenant between the Lord and his Church be no more reputed any branch of the Covenant of Grace, but let it ſtand and fall as a Covenant of workes.</p>
               <p>But ſurely if the greater part of the Church were gone aſtray, I ſhould think it would well become the faithfulneſſe of a Church-Elder, to haſten to them, (ſpecially when he is lovingly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſent for) and to convince them of the errour of their way before the Lord, and to ſeek to bring them back againe to the Biſhop and Shepheard of their ſoules. Sure I am, that in a caſe of greater defection of the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> imagined was found in the Church of <hi>Salem. Paul</hi> did not reject them, but profeſſed; <hi>I deſire</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be preſent with you now, and to change my voyce, for I ſtand in doubt of you,</hi> Gal. 4.20.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> acknowledgeth in the next Paragraph, <hi>That the Church of Coloſſe might ſay to Archippus; Take heed to thy Miniſtery, and that Archippus might negligently, and proudly refuſe to hearken to them: but for his caſe, his faithfulneſſe, and uprightneſſe to God, and the ſoules of the people will witneſſe for him, when his ſoule ſhall come to</hi> Hezekiahs <hi>caſe on his death-bed, and in the great day approaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not know but that <hi>Archippus</hi> might as juſtly refuſe to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to the Church of <hi>Salem.</hi> What though <hi>Coloſſe</hi> was more eminent in gifts then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> yet the mutuall power, and ſubjection of Paſtor and people, dependeth not upon eminency of gifts, but upon the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and their mutuall Covenant, and Relation. If it had been a negligent and proud part in <hi>Archippus</hi> (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) to refuſe to hearken to the lawfull voyce of the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> admoniſhing him of his ſlackneſſe in his Miniſtery: I know not but it might be ſuch a like part in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to refuſe to hearken to the voyce of the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> admoniſhing him to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:160232:110"/>take heed of deſerting his Miniſtery. Whether is a greater ſinne in a Miniſter, not to fulfill his Miniſtery, or to deſert his Miniſtery? Neither doe I know but that <hi>Archippus</hi> might have pretended the like evaſions with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> if not fairer. For he might plead there were amongſt them, ſuch as ſpoyled them through Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and vaine deceit, after the Traditions of men, and Rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt, (<hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.) that beguiled them alſo in a voluntary humilitie, and worſhip of Angels, not holding the Head, (<hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19.) Yea ſo farre that themſelves come to be dogmatized with the Traditions of men, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22. And why might not then <hi>Archippus</hi> as juſtly refuſe to heare the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> refuſe to heare the Church of <hi>Salem?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> pleaſe himſelfe in ſuiting his faithfulneſſe, and uprightneſſe to <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> caſe. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> faithfully, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly endeavoured, and (through grace) procured the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtate Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in the dayes of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ahaz:</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> in ſtead of reforming one Church, renounceth all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For his neglect of hearkening to the ſecond voyce, the voyce and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſo many Elders, and Brethren of other Churches; He ſaith (becauſe he truely eſteemeth the Perſons) he will not anſwer the Argument of numbers, and multitudes againſt one, as our men are wont to anſwer the Popiſh univerſalitie, that God ſtirreth up ſometimes one</hi> Elijah <hi>againſt eight hundred of</hi> Baals <hi>Prieſts, &amp;c. But this he ſaith that</hi> David <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the Princes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and</hi> 30000. <hi>of</hi> Iſrael <hi>carrying up the Arke, were not to be hearkened unto in their holy intentions of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, and triumphs, when the due order of the Lord was wanting to them. In which caſe one Scripture in the mouth of a Mechanick, is to be preferred before a whole Councell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not here obſerve (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> doth in a like caſe, in Chap. 38. of his <hi>Bloudy Tenent</hi>) his haſt and light attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Scriptures which himſelfe alledgeth. The Text ſpeaketh but of 450. of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.19. Now for him to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply them to 800, is to fetch in alſo the Prophets of the Groves, (the Prophets of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves) whom the Text expreſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth from the Prophets of <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to let that paſſe, as not materiall to the Argument, (no more then the miſquotation, which he obſerveth of <hi>Titus</hi> for <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:160232:111"/>we will not reply as the Papiſts doe againſt ſingle witneſſes, let him call for fire from Heaven as <hi>Eliah</hi> did, and we will ſubmit the teſtimonies of many to one ſingle witneſſe: No we call not for Miracles at his hand: but let him produce one teſtimony of holy Scripture (rightly underſtood, and applyed) againſt the advice, and voyce of thoſe Elders, and Brethren, and then though he be but one (yea though that one were but a Mechanick too) we ſhall gratifie his demand, and (by the Grace of Chriſt) be ready rather to hearken to him, then require that he ſhould hearken to us.</p>
               <p>Meane while, we anſwer him as the Apoſtle did to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (1 Cor. 14.36.) <hi>What, came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you onely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>David</hi> and the Princes, and the 30000. of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were not to be hearkened unto, nor followed in their diſorderly carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Arke; becauſe the word of the Lord had given expreſſe order to the contrary, requiring that the <hi>Kohathites</hi> ſhould beare the Arke upon their ſhoulders, and not touch it, leaſt they dye, <hi>Num.</hi> 4.15. Let him ſhew us the like order violated by us, and we ſhall freely excuſe him (yea and juſtifie him) in not hearkening to us, nor following of us.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe ſome one Prophet, or Brother of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the diſorder of <hi>David,</hi> and of the whole Congregation of the 30000. of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had therefore not onely refuſed to follow them, but had proceeded further (as many of Chriſts Diſciples did with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66.) to goe back from them with an utter Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, and to walke no more with them, no not though they were willing to reforme their diſorder, if any were made knowne to them? Would <hi>Perez <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> have juſtified that? Or did that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>David,</hi> and of that Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> diſchurch them all from fellowſhip with God, or diſcharge their Brethren from having any fellowſhip with them, as with the Church of God?</p>

               <head>TO CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>HIs third Chapter is taken up in anſwering to a Phraſe in my Letter, in which I had ſaid, <hi>I endeavoured to ſhew him the ſandineſſe of thoſe grounds, upon which he had baniſhed himſelfe from the fellowſhip of all the Churches in this Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:160232:111"/>
               <p>The ſumme of his Anſwer is, <hi>That his grounds were the firme rocke of the Truth of Jeſus, and that my endeavours to prove them ſandy, are but the weake, and uncertain ſand of mans Invention, which ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore periſh, and burne like hay, or ſtubble; And the Rocky ſtrength of his grounds ſhall appeare in the Lords ſeaſon, and that my ſelfe alſo may yet confeſſe ſo much, as I have</hi> (<hi>ſince I came to</hi> New-England) <hi>confeſt the ſandineſſe of the grounds of many of my Practiſes in</hi> Old England: <hi>and the rockineſſe of their grounds that witneſſed againſt me, and them: for Inſtance, that himſelfe had diſcovered to me, and other ſervants of God, his grounds againſt the uſe of the Common Prayer Booke: which though they then ſeemed ſandy to me, yet ſince I have acknowledged to be rocky, and have ſeene cauſe ſo to publiſh to the world in my Diſcourſe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Ball, <hi>againſt ſet formes of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a reply, let me begin where he leaveth; How ready he is to build upon ſandy grounds, may appeare by this very Paſſage, where he maintaineth his rockineſſe. For here he avoucheth, <hi>I have ſeene cauſe to publiſh to the world, the rockineſſe of his grounds in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Ball <hi>againſt ſet Formes of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What rocky ground doe you thinke this Aſſertion of his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon? I know no other but this; He findeth ſuch a Diſcourſe publiſhed to the world: and he thence concludeth (for other Grounds he hath none) <hi>that I publiſhed that Diſcourſe, and that I ſaw cauſe to publiſh it:</hi> both which hang upon that ground like ropes of ſand. The truth is, I did not publiſh that Diſcourſe to the world, much leſſe did I ſee cauſe to publiſh it upon the Grounds he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. A briefe Diſcourſe in defence of ſet formes of Prayer was penned by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ball,</hi> much briefer then that which ſince is put forth in Print. That briefe Diſcourſe a religious Knight ſent over, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my ſelfe, or to a Gentleman of note then dwelling in my houſe, I remember not) but with deſire to heare our judgement of it. At his requeſt I drew up a ſhort Anſwer, and ſent one Copie of it to the Knight, and another to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ball,</hi> divers yeares agoe. How it came (in proceſſe of time) to be publiſhed to the world, or by whom, I doe not know. And yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> doubteth not to affirme it, that <hi>I publiſhed that Diſcourſe to the world, and ſaw cauſe to doe it.</hi> Rocky ſpirits can expreſſe all their conceits, in rocky firmneſſe, though upon ſandy conjectures.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when he ſaith, <hi>That himſelfe diſcovered to me, and to other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:160232:112"/>ſervants of God, his grounds againſt our uſing of the Common Prayer; which then ſeemed ſandy to us, but now in</hi> New-England, <hi>I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be rocky in my Diſcourſe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Ball. I could have wiſhed he had expreſſed, what grounds thoſe were, which he diſcovered to us; For my ſelfe I can call to minde no ſuch matter, that ever I heard, or received from him, either by word, or writing, any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide grounds againſt that Practiſe. But this I am ſure of, that the grounds of altering my judgement touching that practiſe, did chiefly ſtand upon the expoſition of the ſecond Commandement; which if I ſhould ſay, I received from him, I ſhould greatly feare my forehead were more rocky then his grounds were. I thinke it no diſgrace to change either my judgement or practiſe upon better grounds then I formerly diſcerned. Nor would I thinke it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to learne any grounds of truth, and to profeſſe that I had learned them from himſelfe, if ſo I had done. But ſure I am, it hath not been wont to be the manner of the ſervants of God to upbraid their Brethren, with their Retractations of their former Aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>I have read of the Churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> that when they heard <hi>Paul</hi> now preached the Faith, which once he deſtroyed, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God for him, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23, 24.) but I never read, that any of the Churches of Chriſt, or any ſincere member of the Churches, did ever upbraid <hi>Paul</hi> for his former Perſecution, or for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent change.</p>
               <p>The other part of the Chapter, he ſpendeth in relating the grounds of the ſentence of his Baniſhment, and in the avouchment of his confidence of the firmeneſſe of them.</p>
               <p>The grounds of the ſentence of his Baniſhment, ſome whereof <hi>He ſaith I am pleaſed to diſcuſſe in the Letter, and others not to mention; He ſaith were rightly ſummed up by one of the Magiſtrates after his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tryall, and Anſwers.</hi>

                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Williams <hi>(ſaid that publick Perſon) holdeth forth theſe foure particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That we have not our Land by Patent from the King, but that the Natives are the true owners of it; and that we ought to repent of ſuch a receiving it by Patent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is not lawfull to call a wicked Perſon to ſweare, to pray, as being actions of Gods worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:160232:112"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That it is not lawfull to heare any of the Miniſters of the Pariſh-Aſſemblies in</hi> England.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Civill Magiſtrates Power extends onely to the bodies, and goods, and outward ſtate of men, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe particulars he hopeth, that as he maintained the rockie ſtrength of them to his own, and other Conſciences ſatisfaction: So (through the Lords aſſiſtance,) he ſhall be ready not onely to be bound, and baniſhed, but to dye alſo in</hi> New-England, <hi>as for moſt holy Truths of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not my intent in that Letter which he examineth, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the Grounds of his Civill Baniſhment at all, neither did I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe one or other of them. And it is a prepoſterous ſhifting of the State of the Queſtion, to put it upon me to give account of the cauſes of his Baniſhment, who neither did baniſh him, nor provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Court to baniſh him out of the Countrey. The Magiſtrates and Deputies of the Common-wealth (who were then the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Court) are all of them of age, and able themſelves to give account of their own actions. To them or ſome of them he ſhould in reaſon have addreſſed himſelfe for ſatisfaction in this caſe (if any were due) and not to me, who am as ſeldome preſent at any Civill Court, (if not more ſeldome) then any man of our calling in Towne or Countrey, where the Courts are kept. It were more then <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage to me, and more then Pharaonicall tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in him, to exact of me, an account of all the capitall, or notable ſentences of Judgement, which paſſe in all the Civill Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the Countrey, unleſſe I had a calling to ſit amongſt them.</p>
               <p>But why did I then endeavour in my Letter <hi>to ſhew him the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of thoſe grounds, upon which he had baniſhed himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> If I did not meane to declare, and diſcuſſe the cauſes of his Baniſhment?</p>
               <p>He doth very well, and wiſely to expreſſe the Grounds upon which I ſaid he baniſhed himſelfe with an, &amp;c. For he knows that if he had related my whole ſentence in my own words, he had cut off himſelfe from all opportunitie of pleading with me the cauſes of his Civill Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>My words are plaine, — <hi>I endeavour to ſhew you the ſandineſſe of thoſe grounds, upon which you have baniſhed your ſelfe from the fellowſhip of all the Churches in theſe Countreyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one thing to baniſh ones ſelfe (or to be baniſhed) out of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:160232:113"/>fellowſhip of all the Churches in the Countrey; another thing to baniſh ones ſelfe (or to be baniſhed) out of the Countrey. There be at this day that baniſh (and ſeparate) themſelves from all the Churches in the Countrey, and yet are not baniſhed out of the Countrey: and there be that are baniſhed out of the Countrey, and yet are not baniſhed out of the fellowſhip of all the Churches in the Countrey. Himſelfe hath ſeparated (and ſo baniſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) from the fellowſhip of all the Churches in the world: and yet he hath not baniſhed himſelfe out of the world.</p>
               <p>But though it be impertinent to my Letter to diſcuſſe the grounds of his Civill Baniſhment: yet ſince he is pleaſed (by hook or crook) to draw it in, I referre the Reader for Anſwer to a full Treatiſe of that Argument, penned by a reverend faithfull Brother, (the Teacher of the Church at <hi>Rocksbury;</hi>) and withall as I have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſomewhat of it above in Anſwer to his Preface, ſo I ſhall ſpeak a word or two more unto it here.</p>
               <p>Whom that eminent Magiſtrate was, that ſo ſummed up the grounds of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his Baniſhment in thoſe foure Particulars above mentioned, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> doth wiſely conceale his name, leſt if he were named, he ſhould be occaſioned to beare witneſſe againſt ſuch fraudulent expreſſion of the Particulars: whereof ſome were no cauſes of his Baniſhment at all, and ſuch as were cauſes, were not delivered in ſuch generall Tearmes. For <hi>in univerſalibus latet Dolus.</hi> It is evident the two latter cauſes which he giveth of his Baniſhment, were no cauſes at all, as he expreſſeth them. There are many knowne to hold both theſe Opinions, <hi>That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to heare any of the Miniſters of the Pariſh-Aſſemblies in</hi> England, <hi>and that the Civill Magiſtrates power extendeth onely to the bodies, and goods, and outward eſtates of men:</hi> and yet they are tolerated not onely to live in the Common-wealth, but alſo in the fellowſhip of the Churches.</p>
               <p>The two former, though they be not ſo much noyſed, yet there be many, if not moſt, that hold, <hi>That we have not our Land, meerly by right of Patent from the King, but that the Natives are true owners of all that they poſſeſſe, or improve.</hi> Neither doe I know any amongſt us, that either then were, or now are of another minde.</p>
               <p>And as for the other Point; <hi>That it is not lawfull to call a wicked Perſon to ſweare, or pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:160232:113"/>
               <p>Though that be not commonly held, yet it is knowne to be held of ſome, who yet are tolerated to enjoy both Civill, and Church-liberties amongſt us.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to Particulars: Two things there were, which (to my beſt obſervation, and remembrance) cauſed the Sentence of his Baniſhment: and two other fell in, that haſtened it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His violent and tumultuous carriage againſt the Patent.</p>
               <p>By the Patent it is, that we received allowance from the King to depart his Kingdome, and to carry our goods with us, without offence to his Officers, and without paying cuſtome to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>By the Patent, certain ſelect men (as Magiſtrates, and Freemen) have power to make Lawes, and the Magiſtrates to execute Juſtice, and Judgement amongſt the People, according to ſuch Lawes.</p>
               <p>By the Patent we have Power to erect ſuch a Government of the Church, as is moſt agreeable to the Word, to the eſtate of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to the gaining of Natives (in Gods time) firſt to Civility, and then to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>To this Authority eſtabliſhed by this Patent, <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> doe readily ſubmit themſelves: and foraine Plantations (the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi>) doe willingly tranſact their Negotiations with us, as with a Colony eſtabliſhed by the Royall Authority of the State of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Patent, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> publickly, and vehemently preached againſt, as containing matter of falſhood, and injuſtice: Falſhood in making the King the firſt Chriſtian Prince who had diſcovered theſe parts: and injuſtice, in giving the Countrey to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, which belonged to the Native <hi>Indians.</hi> This therefore he preſſed upon the Magiſtrates and People, to be humbled for from time to time in dayes of ſolemne Humiliation, and to returne the Patent back againe to the King. It was anſwered to him, firſt, That it was neither the Kings intendment, nor the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to take poſſeſſion of the Countrey by murther of the Natives, or by robbery: but either to take poſſeſſion of the voyd places of the Countrey by the Law of Nature, (for <hi>Vacuum Domicilium cedit occupanti:</hi>) or if we tooke any Lands from the Natives, it was by way of purchaſe, and free conſent.</p>
               <p>A little before our coming, God had by peſtilence, and other contagious diſeaſes, ſwept away many thouſands of the Natives,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:160232:114"/>who had inhabited the Bay of <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> for which the Patent was granted. Such few of them as ſurvived were glad of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who might preſerve them from the oppreſſion of the <hi>Naharganſets.</hi> For it is the manner of the Natives, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nations to oppreſſe the weaker.</p>
               <p>This anſwer did not ſatisfie M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> who pleaded, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though they did not, nor could ſubdue the Countrey, (but left it <hi>vacuum Domicilium</hi>) yet they hunted all the Countrey over, and for the expedition of their hunting voyages, they burnt up all the underwoods in the Countrey, once or twice a yeare, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Noble men in <hi>England</hi> poſſeſſed great Parkes, and the King, great Forreſts in <hi>England</hi> onely for their game, and no man might lawfully invade their Propriety: So might the Natives challenge the like Propriety of the Countrey here.</p>
               <p>It was replyed unto him. 1. That the King, and Noble men in <hi>England,</hi> as they poſſeſſed greater Territories then other men, ſo they did greater ſervice to Church, and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they employed their Parkes, and Forreſts, not for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely, but for Timber, and for the nouriſhment of tame beaſts, as well as wild, and alſo for habitation to ſundry Tenants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our Townes here did not diſturb the huntings of the Natives, but did rather keepe their Game fitter for their taking; for they take their Deere by Traps, and not by Hounds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That if they complained of any ſtraites wee put upon them, wee gave ſatisfaction in ſome payments, or other, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We did not conceive that it is a juſt Title to ſo vaſt a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, to make no other improvement of millions of Acres in it, but onely to burne it up for paſtime.</p>
               <p>But theſe Anſwers not ſatisfying him, this was ſtill preſſed by him as a Nationall ſinne, to hold to the Patent, yea, and a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall duty to renounce the Patent: which to have done, had ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fundamentall State, and Government of the Countrey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond offence, which procured his Baniſhment, was occaſioned as I touched before. The Magiſtrates, and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Generall Court upon Intelligence of ſome Epiſcopall, and malignant practiſes againſt the Countrey, they made an order of Court to take tryall of the fidelitie of the People, (not by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:160232:114"/>upon them, but) by offering to them an Oath of Fidelitie: that in caſe any ſhould refuſe to take it, they might not betruſt them with place of publick charge, and Command. This Oath when it came abroad, he vehemently withſtood it, and diſſwaded ſundry from it, partly becauſe it was, as he ſaid, Chriſts Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to have his Office eſtabliſhed by Oath: partly becauſe an oath was a part of Gods worſhip, and Gods worſhip was not to be put upon carnall perſons, as he conceived many of the People to be. So by his Tenent neither might Church-members, nor other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, take the Oath, becauſe it was the eſtabliſhment not of Chriſt, but of mortall men in their office; nor might men out of the Church take it, becauſe in his eye they were but carnall. So the Court was forced to deſiſt from that proceeding: which practiſe of his was held to be the more dangerous, becauſe it tended to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle all the Kingdomes, and Common-wealths in Europe.</p>
               <p>Theſe were (as I tooke it) the cauſes of his Baniſhment: two other things fell in upon theſe that haſtened the Sentence. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fell out thus: The Magiſtrates diſcerning by the former paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the heady and turbulent ſpirit of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> both they, and others adviſed the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> not to call him to office in their Church; nevertheleſſe, the major part of the Church made choice of him. Soone after, when the Church made ſuit to the Court for a parcell of Land adjoyning to them, the Court delayed to grant their Requeſt (as hath been mentioned before) becauſe the Church had refuſed to hearken to the Magiſtrates, and others in forbearing the choice of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams.</hi> Whereupon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> took occaſion to ſtirre up the Church to joyne with him in writing Letters of Admonition unto all the Churches, whereof thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were members, to admoniſh them of their open tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Rule of Juſtice. Which Letters coming to the ſeverall Churches, provoked the Magiſtrates to take the more ſpeedy courſe with ſo heady, and violent a Spirit.</p>
               <p>But to prevent his ſufferings, (if it might be) it was mooved by ſome of the Elders, that themſelves might have liberty (according to the Rule of Chriſt) to deale with him, and with the Church alſo in a Church-way. It might be, the Church might heare us, and he the Church; which being conſented to, ſome of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wrote to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> to preſent before them the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:160232:115"/>Spirit, and way of their Officer, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi>) both in Judgement, and Practiſe. The Church finally began to hearken to us, and accordingly began to addreſſe themſelves to the healing of his Spirit. Which he diſcerning, renounced communion with the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> pretending they held communion with the Churches in the Bay, and the Churches in the Bay held commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Pariſh-Churches in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they ſuffered their members to heare the word amongſt them in <hi>England,</hi> as they came over into their native Countrey. He then refuſing to reſort to the Publick Aſſembly of the Church. Soone after ſundry began to reſort to his Family, where he preached to them on the Lords day. But this carriage of his in renouncing the Church upon ſuch an occaſion, and with them all the Churches in the Countrey, and the ſpreading of his Leaven to ſundry that reſorted to him; this gave the Magiſtrates the more cauſe to obſerve the heady unrueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſpirit, and the incorrigibleneſſe thereof by any Church-way, all the Churches in the Countrey being then renounced by him. And this was the other occaſion which haſtened the Sentence of his Baniſhment, upon the former Grounds.</p>
               <p>If upon theſe Grounds M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> be ready, (as he profeſſeth) <hi>not onely to be bound, and baniſhed, but alſo to dye in</hi> New-England; let him remember, (what he knowes) <hi>Non poena, ſed cauſa facit Martyrem;</hi> No Martyr of Chriſt did ever ſuffer for ſuch a cauſe.</p>
               <p>When he feareth not to profeſſe, that <hi>he did in open Court main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the rocky ſtrength of his grounds, to the ſatisfaction of his own, and (as he ſaith) of other mens Conſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can but wonder at the rocky flintineſſe of his ſelfe-confidence: To give a taſte of the rocky ſtrength of his maintenance of theſe things; He made complaint in open Court, that he was wronged by a ſlanderous report up and downe the Countrey, as if he did hold it to be unlawfull for a Father to call upon his childe to eate his meate. Our reverend Brother M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker,</hi> (the Paſtor of the Church, where the Court was then kept) being mooved to ſpeake a word to it, Why, ſaith he, you will ſay as much againe, (if you ſtand to your own Principles) or be forced to ſay nothing. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> was confident he ſhould never ſay it: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, If it be unlawfull to call an unregenerate perſon to take an Oath, or to Pray, as being actions of Gods worſhip, then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:160232:115"/>for your unregenerate childe, to pray for a bleſſing upon his own meate. If it be unlawfull for him to pray for a bleſſing upon his meate, it is unlawfull for him to eate it, (for it is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by prayer, and without prayer unſanctified, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5.) If it be unlawfull for him to eate it, it is unlawfull for you to call upon him to eate it, for it is unlawfull for you to call upon him to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> thought better to hold his peace, then to give an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>But thus have I opened the grounds, and occaſions of his Civill Baniſhment; which whether they be ſandy, or rocky, let the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt judge. Howſoever, my Letter gave him no occaſion at all to put me upon this Diſcourſe; for in my Letter I intended only to ſhew him <hi>the ſandineſſe of thoſe grounds upon which he baniſhed himſelfe from the ſociety (not of the Common-wealth, but) of all the Churches in theſe Countreyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether I intended the one, or the other, he giveth an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for both; <hi>If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Cotton <hi>meane</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my own voluntary withdrawing from all theſe Churches reſolved to continue in thoſe evills, and in perſecuting the witneſſes of the Lord, preſenting light unto them. I confeſſe it was mine own voluntary act: yea I hope the act of the Lord Jeſus ſounding forth in me (a poore deſpiſed Rams-horne) the blaſt which ſhall in his own holy ſeaſon caſt down the ſtrength, and confidence of the Inventions of men in the worſhip of God: and laſtly his act in ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling me to be faithfull in any meaſure to ſuffer ſuch great, and mightie Tryalls for his Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply, That I meant onely his own act in withdrawing himſelfe from theſe Churches, doth plainly enough appeare both from my expreſſe words, and fro mthe Reaſons which I expreſly aſſigne of that act of his, which I called the ſandy grounds, upon which he built his Separation. My expreſſe words are, <hi>He had baniſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the ſociety of all the Churches in this Countrey.</hi> The ſociety of the Church is one thing, the ſociety of the Common-wealth, is another. And the Grounds upon which he built his Separation, were not the cauſes of his baniſhment, but of his withdrawing from the ſociety of the Churches.</p>
               <p>But if I ſo meant, <hi>He confeſſeth it was his own voluntary act; and profeſſeth alſo, it was a double act of the Lord Jeſus in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:160232:116"/>
               <p>The ground which he giveth of his own voluntary act, <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Churches were reſolved to continue in thoſe evills, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the witneſſes of the Lord Jeſus, preſenting light to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply; Thoſe evills? What were thoſe evills, which wee were reſolved to continue in? He expreſſeth none: but ſure meet it had been, that as his voluntary withdrawing from theſe Churches was publickly known; ſo the evills in which we reſolved to continue, and for which he withdrew himſelfe, ſhould in like manner have been publickly knowne alſo. It is an unrighteous thing to paſſe publick known acts, upon private unknowne evills. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe unknown evills were, I ſuppoſe he conceiveth them to be ſuch wayes, either of Judgement, or Practiſe, wherein wee walke according to the light of our Conſciences. And then by his Rule he ſhould have allowed us the like liberty of conſcience, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe requireth. And ſurely by the Royall Rule of the Lord Jeſus, no Brother may be ſo much as admoniſhed, (much leſſe ſeparated from) till he be convinced, <hi>(<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) Mat.</hi> 18.15.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>perſecuting the witneſſes of the Lord, preſenting light to us;</hi> himſelfe (for ought I know) was the firſt in this Countrey, that ever pretended ſuffering for bearing witneſſe in any matter of Religion true or falſe: And for him to withdraw himſelfe from the ſociety of all the Churches for their perſecution of him, before he had ſuffered from them any thing but conference, and conviction, is to make them ſufferers for well-doing, and to chooſe ſuffering, that he might have cauſe to complaine of ſufferings. Let him, if he be able, name any one in this Countrey of the witneſſes of the Lord, (for he ſpeaketh of witneſſes) that ever did ſo much as pretend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelfe to ſuffer Perſecution, for preſenting light to us.</p>
               <p>Thus he maketh that the ground of his withdrawing, which was not then <hi>in Rerum naturâ,</hi> (no not in pretence) till after his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing. As a furious School-maſter will beate a childe for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till he cry, and then beate him for crying.</p>
               <p>But he further preſumeth to affirme; <hi>That his withdrawing was the act of the Lord Jeſus in him, ſounding forth that Blaſt, which ſhall one day caſt downe the ſtrength, and confidence of the Inventions of men in the worſhip of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. If a particular viſible Church, conſiſting of viſible Saints, and united by holy Covenant into one Congregation, to worſhip
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:160232:116"/>the Lord, and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances; If ſuch a Church be an Invention of man; If Elders called, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them for Adminiſtration of theſe Ordinances, be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of man; If the Covenant of Grace between the Lord, and his Church, and the Seales thereof, and the Cenſures diſpenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violation thereof; If all theſe be the Inventions of man, then indeed the Lord hath ſounded a blaſt in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his horne, to caſt down the Inventions of men in the worſhip of God. But if all theſe be the holy Inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus, then let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> know, that this ſpeech of his is a blaſt of blaſphemy againſt the Lord Jeſus, to put upon him that which is the proper worke of Satan, to blaſt all the Churches, and Ordinances of Chriſt. And whereas it was wont to be the worke of Antichriſt to defile all the Ordinances of Chriſt, it is now the worke of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer to deface, and aboliſh them all from the face of the earth. Whether of theſe workes are the more Antichriſtian? It may be he will be ready to ſay, (as the Prophet ſaid in another caſe of <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi> Iſai. 10.7.) he meaneth not ſo, nor doth his heart thinke ſo: and as <hi>Hazael</hi> ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould doe this great thing?</hi> (2 King. 8.13.) <hi>Sed quid verba audiam, cùm facta videam?</hi> Why doth he ſeparate from all Churches under Heaven, and refuſe to gather into any Church where himſelfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, if he did not in theſe times look at all Church-Eſtate, and Fellowſhip, and Ordinances, as not to be found in the Land of the Living?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>He looketh at it, as an act of Chriſt enabling him to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in any meaſure, to ſuffer ſuch great and mightie Tryalls for his Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Spirit of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had in ſome meaſure reſted upon him, he would no more have mentioned (much leſſe have magnified) his great, and mighty Tryalls, till he had ſeene <hi>John</hi> goe before him in ſuch a like predication of his ſufferings, who doubtleſſe had leſſe deſerved it, and yet ſuffered more great, and mighty Tryalls, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.9. But full veſſels make leaſt ſound.</p>
               <p>Againe, He recoyleth to his civill Baniſhment, and obſerveth, <hi>That if by baniſhing himſelfe I meant his Civill Baniſhment, then</hi> 1. <hi>He diſcerneth the language of the Dragon in a Lambes lip; to put the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Saints upon themſelves, and the Devill.</hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:160232:117"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That I ſilently confeſſe, that the frame and conſtitution of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is implicitly Nationall. Elſe if the Common-wealth, and Church were not one, how could he that is baniſhed from the one, be neceſſarily baniſhed from the other alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. It was farre from my meaning, and words, when I ſpake of his baniſhing of himſelfe from the Fellowſhip of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Countrey, to intend his civill baniſhment. I knew his civill baniſhment was not meerly his own Act. I knew alſo that he might have been baniſhed from the Common-wealth, and yet have retained (as ſome others have done) Fellowſhip with ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if not with all the Churches in the Countrey. And therefore both his obſervations are but empty flouriſhes, and vaniſh like Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. It is the wilineſſe of the Spirit of the Serpent, to hide his head under fig-leaved evaſions.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe I had meant by his baniſhment of himſelfe, his civill baniſhment, and had meant, that by expoſing himſelfe deſervedly to that cenſure, he had deprived himſelfe of enjoying all the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall liberties of the Churches in the Countrey: might I not ſo have ſaid, and yet not have ſpoken the language of the Dragon? What if the Dragon uſe ſuch language to the Saints ſuffering innocently? may not the Spirit of God uſe the ſame words to a guilty perſon ſuffering deſervedly? The language of the Dragon lyeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the words or meaning, but in the application, and intent of them. The Dragon ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>I know who thou art, the holy One of God,</hi> Mar. 1.24. <hi>Peter</hi> might ſay the ſame, or the like words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. And yet in his mouth, it was not the language of the Dragon, but of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Neither will it imply, That the Church, and Common-wealth, are all one, becauſe he that deſervedly is baniſhed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, baniſheth himſelfe alſo from the communion of the Churches; For the ſame ſinnes which may be offenſive civilly to the Common-wealth, may be alſo ſpiritually offenſive to the Church, and both proceed to cenſure the ſame perſon in their own way, ſeverally.</p>

               <p>IN his fourth Chapter the Examiner anſwereth to a ſpeech of mine, wherein to prevent his prejudice againſt my perſon, (which might weaken the fruit of my counſell to him) <hi>I told him, I had not haſted forward the ſentence of his Civill Baniſhment: and that what was done by the Magiſtrates in that kinde, was neither done by my Counſell, nor conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto he anſwereth, firſt, <hi>That he obſerveth, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is hard for any man to doe good, or to ſpeake effectually to the ſoule, or Conſcience of any, whoſe body he afflicteth, and perſecuteth, and that onely for their ſoule and Conſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. All that can truely be obſerved from my words is, That it is hard for any to take good from thoſe, againſt whom they have conceived a prejudice, whether juſtly, or unjuſtly. But when he ſubjoyneth a Serpentine, that is, a ſubtile, and venomous inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, <hi>as if I had afflicted, and perſecuted his body, and that onely for his ſoule, and Conſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have been ſo farre from afflicting, or perſecuting his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (eſpecially for his ſoule, or conſcience ſake) that in very truth, whileſt I had any hope of prevailing for him, I may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid for himſelfe, againſt a like ſlander, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.3, 4. <hi>I have ſought to deliver him who without cauſe reproacheth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> pleaſe himſelfe (as he doth in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) in comparing the dealing of the Elders with him here, to the Perſecutions of the Biſhops againſt the godly Preachers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If the Biſhops had dealt no worſe with the godly Preachers there, and upon no more unjuſt cauſes, then the Elders dealt with him here, they might with good conſcience, and good countenance have looked with comfort, and confidence, both God, and man in the face, even now when God hath laid their carnall pompe, and worldly honour in the duſt.</p>
               <p>Neither let him pleaſe himſelfe (as he doth in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) in his undoubted Aſſertion; <hi>That what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton, <hi>and others did in procuring his ſorrowes, was not without ſome regret, and reluctancy of Conſcience, and affection, (as</hi> David <hi>in procuring</hi> Uriah's <hi>death, or</hi> Aſa <hi>in impriſoning the Prophet.</hi>)</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:160232:118"/>
               <p>For neither was he ſo innocent, as was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: nor had my ſelfe the like hand in his ſufferings, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> had in the other: nor did I ever ſee cauſe of regret, and reluctancy of conſcience, for any act of mine own about his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

               <p>That I conſented not to his Baniſhment, he in part admitteth; <hi>For what need was there</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of that, being not one of the Civill Court?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if I might not have conſented to it, though I needed not to have done it. I might have drawn up Articles againſt him, I might have come in as a witneſſe againſt him, I might have ſolicited, and ſtirred up the body of the Magiſtrates againſt him, to rid the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of him: and then I had conſented before-hand to what was done by the Magiſtrates in that kinde, though my ſelfe had been none of the Court; but none of all theſe acts, nor any ſuch like were done by me.</p>
               <p>But be it that I conſented not, yet I counſelled it, (and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) and to prove that he ſaith, <hi>He will produce a double, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Teſtimony for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That I publickly taught, (and ſtill doe Teach, except lately Chriſt hath taught me better) that body-killing, ſoule-killing, and State-killing Doctrine of Perſecuting all other Conſciences, and wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but mine own, in the Civill State, and conſequently in the whole world, if the Power, or Empire thereof were in mine hand.</hi>

               <p>Reply.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:160232:118"/>of worſhip, the infallible Rule, and ſoveraigne Standard, by which all conſciences, and wayes of worſhip throughout the world, were to be regulated: yea, and as if this were a light meaſure of arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and uſurpation, I make it a capitall crime, (a body-killing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) for any man to ſwerve from my conſcience, and way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, even in ſuch Points wherein the Holy Ghoſt hath given ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge, that we ſhould not judge, nor condemne one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. But I durſt appeale even unto the conſcience of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelfe, (if it were now in the gracious keeping of Chriſt, or of himſelfe, as in former times) that himſelfe knoweth, I doe not thinke it lawfull to Excommunicate an Heretick, much leſſe to perſecute him with the civill Sword, till it may appeare, even by juſt and full conviction, that he ſinneth not out of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but againſt the very light of his own conſcience. Sure I am, ſuch a Point he reporteth is received from me, to the very ſame purpoſe, (and he reporteth it truely) in his <hi>Bloudy Tenent,</hi> pag. 8. This Anſwer may ſuffice to his firſt (as he calleth it) <hi>unanſwerable Teſtimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond unanſwerable Teſtimony is, <hi>That ſome Gentlemen that did conſent to his Sentence, have ſolemnly teſtified, and with teares ſince confeſſed to himſelfe, that they could not in their ſoules have been brought to have conſented to the Sentence of his Baniſhment, had not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>in private given them advice, and counſell, proving it juſt, and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Conſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply. I might here juſtly plead the equitie of the Romane Cuſtome, to excuſe my ſelfe from this accuſation, untill the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers come before me face to face: And truely, if Apocryphall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes may goe for unanſwerable Teſtimonies, it is an eaſie matter to oppreſſe any innocency: I might alſo plead the incompetency of ſuch a witneſſe, as (haply lying under ſome cenſure from our Church, and removing himſelfe from our fellowſhip) might take more liberty to ſpeake againſt me in a pang of paſſion, what he would be loath to juſtifie in cold bloud.) I might likewiſe alledge that one or two Magiſtrates makes not a Court, nor was his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence caſt by the vote of one, or two: So that if I had counſelled one or two to it, it would not argue that the act of the Magiſtrates, and of the Deputies, (which is the body of the Court) had been done by my counſell or conſent. And indeed it was the very true
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:160232:119"/>meaning of my ſpeech, that for the haſtening of the Sentence of the Court againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> that act of the Court (which was the act of the body of the Magiſtrates, and of the Deputies) it was neither done by my counſell, nor conſent. For the body of them neither required my counſell, nor received my conſent. What one of them did (for I remember but one that conſulted with me about it) was not the act done by the Magiſtrates, whereof I ſpake. And let the occaſion, and ſcope, and matter of that ſpeech be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and it will be found to tend to that purpoſe, and no other. About a yeare before the Sentence in Court paſſed againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> the Governour, and other Magiſtrates having underſtood of the diſturbances put upon the Civill State by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> (which have been declared above) they ſent for the Elders of the Churches in theſe parts, to acquaint us therewith, and to declare thereupon, the juſt grounds which they had to proceed againſt him: yet willing to conferre thereof with us, becauſe he was an Elder of a Church. I doe not love to predicate mine own good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to any: but his importunitie forceth me to utter it; when I heard the motion, I preſented (with the conſent of my fellow El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brethren) a ſerious Requeſt to the Magiſtrates, that they would be pleaſed to forbeare all civill proſecution againſt him, till our ſelves (with our Churches) had dealt with him in a Church way, to convince him of ſinne: alledging, that my ſelfe, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hoped, his violent courſe did rather ſpring from ſcruple of conſcience, (though carried with an inordinate zeale) then from a ſeditious Principle. To which the Governour replyed, <hi>That wee were deceived in him, if we thought he would condeſcend to learne of any of us: And what will you doe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when you have run your courſe, and found all your labour loſt?</hi> I anſwered for the reſt, we hoped bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things: if it fell out contrary to our hopes, we could not helpe it, but muſt ſit downe, and quiet our conſcience in the Lords ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our will, and endeavour for the deed.</p>
               <p>This interceding of my ſelfe, and other Elders in his behalfe, gave me juſt occaſion of that profeſſion above-mentioned, <hi>That I had ſought to deliver him, who without cauſe reproached mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The iſſue was when the Church of <hi>New-Towne,</hi> with our owne, and others had endeavoured to convince both M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> of theſe offences, and the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> of their indulgent tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:160232:119"/>of him therein; it pleaſed the Lord to open the hearts of the Church to aſſiſt us in dealing with him: but he in ſtead of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, either to them, or us, renounced us all, as no Churches of Chriſt: and therefore not at all to be hearkened unto.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Magiſtrates being to aſſemble to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Court at <hi>New-Towne,</hi> intending (as appeared by the event) to proceed againſt him: And one of the Magiſtrates of our Towne being to goe thither, acquainted me that it was likely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his cauſe would then be iſſued, and asked me what I thought of it. <hi>Truely</hi> (ſaid I,) <hi>I pitie the man, and have already interceded for him, whileſt there was any hope of doing good. But now he having refuſed to heare both his own Church, and us, and having rejected us all, as no Churches of Chriſt before any conviction, we have now no more to ſay in his behalfe, nor hope to prevaile for him. Wee have told the Governour, and Magiſtrates before, that if our labour was in vaine, wee could not helpe it, but muſt fit downe. And you know they are generally ſo much incenſed againſt his courſe, that it is not your voyce, nor the voyces of two, or three more, that can ſuſpend the Sentence. Some further ſpeech I had with him of mine own marvell at the weakneſſe, and ſlenderneſſe of the grounds of his opinions, motions, and courſes, and yet carried on with ſuch vehemency, and impetuouſneſſe, and prefidence of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe was my ſpeech to him, nor can I call to minde that I ſpake ſo much as this to any man elſe; nor can I remember at all, that further then ſo, I gave him any grounds to prove the ſentencing of him to Baniſhment, to be juſt and warrantable to his Conſcience. Nor would it infringe the truth of my ſpeech if I had ſo done, ſeeing it is not one mans vote (nor two, if there had been two) that denominateth the ſentence of the Court, or the act to be done by the Magiſtrates, much leſſe done by the Magiſtrates with my counſell, and conſent: but though I looked at the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court, as neither haſtened nor done by my counſell, and conſent, yet I did never intend to ſay, that I did not conſent to the juſtice of the Sentence when it was paſt. Not that I withdrew my ſelfe out of the Court (as he is pleaſed to conſtrue it) <hi>out of ſome reluctation; or that I meant it, I neither counſelled nor conſented in the very time of the ſentence paſſing:</hi> but that I did not before-hand either give counſell, or conſent to the body of the Magiſtrates, or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to paſſe that Sentence againſt him.</p>

               <head>TO CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>I ſee I have been ſo large in anſwering the former foure Chapters of this Examination of my Letter, that if I ſhould proceed in the like ſort in a particular ſearch of the other twenty-foure Chapters which remaine, I ſhould take up more time then were meet about the perſonall concernments of him, or my ſelfe. Who are wee, that we ſhould publickly invite the ſervants of Chriſt (who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in more weighty affaires of their Lord and ours) to attend unto perſonall Tranſactions between him, and me? Where any thing ſhall occurre tending to more publick edification, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with more attention thereupon, and paſſe over other lighter Diſcourſes, with a lighter touch. Yet who ſo can ſpare ſo much time, and leiſure, as to compare each Chapter of his, with each Chapter of this Diſcourſe, he ſhall finde (if I be not miſtaken) no paſſage of weight paſſed over without returning due Anſwer to each particular. That Text in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>(He that withholdeth the Corne,</hi> (which is the ſtaffe of life) <hi>from the people, the multitude ſhall curſe him:) I alledged to prove that the people had much more cauſe to ſeparate ſuch from amongst them, (whether by Civill, or Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as doe withhold, or ſeparate them from the Ordinances, or the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances from them, which are (in Chriſt) the bread of life.</hi> Let not the Reader be ſo farre miſ-led by the Examiner his miſ-information, as to thinke, that this Scripture was produced againſt him, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either a falſe Miniſtery, or an unfit people to chooſe and enjoy a true Miniſtery. The Miniſtery, and people, are the Miniſtery and people of this Countrey: of which, the people he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be Saints: and the Miniſters of the Churches (choſen by them) not to be deſtitute of ſuch qualifications, as Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, ſave onely that we doe not forbid the people when they goe over into <hi>England,</hi> to heare the word of God preached by godly Miniſters in the Pariſh Churches. Now for this cauſe, becauſe we doe not ſeparate theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearers from us, he ſeparated himſelfe, and withdre others from hearing the word in our Churches with us: which I accounted as great, and as unſufferable an injury to the ſoules of Gods people, as it would be to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to withhold the Corne from them, or them from the Corne: and for that end I produced this Scripture.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:160232:120"/>
               <p>That I produced this Scripture alone to juſtifie the Sentence of the Court, it was not for want of others, (if that had been the Queſtion;) but becauſe the ſcope of my Letter was, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the equitie of his Baniſhment, but to convince the iniquitie of his Separation. The mention of the cauſe of his civill Baniſhment fell in onely upon the by, to remove an objection out of the way, that becauſe I denied the act of the Court to be done by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or conſent, therefore it might ſeeme I diſallowed the ſentence. To prevent that miſtake I acknowledged the righteouſneſſe of the Sentence, and for that end produced that Scripture, as that which might give both ſome juſt reaſon before God of his Civill Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and alſo make way for the diſcovery of his ſinne of ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Separation. Let no man be ſo farre miſtaken, as to thinke, that his Separation from the Churches, was either the chiefe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Court and him, (though it was the chiefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me in my Letter;) or that it was the chiefeſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for which he ſuffered, though he ſo pretended.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Let him make it appeare, that Chriſt hath not committed the Miniſtery of the Goſpel to us; and wee ſhall give place to others whom Chriſt ſhall ſend: Meane while, if the budding, and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming, and fruit-bearing of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod was a witneſſe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Lord approved his Miniſtery againſt all the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Num. 17.5. to 8.

               <p>
                  <hi>What if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>ſaw juſt cauſe to refuſe to ſell ſpirituall Corne in a miſ-hallowed Surplice?</hi> Is it ſafe therefore for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to ſhut up his ſacks mouth, and to refuſe to ſell corne in his ordinary apparrell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>forbeare to adminiſter the Lords Supper to all beleevers, or Baptiſme unto their children, untill the beleevers profeſſe their Faith, and Repentance before the Church?</hi> Is it ſafe therefore for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> to refuſe to Breake the Bread of Life unto the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> whereunto their Election, and Ordination of him, and his own voluntary acceptance thereof, had engaged him unto ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly office?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What though in all Civill Tranſactions, and in all the preſent diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of</hi> England, <hi>principall reſpect is had unto a right Commiſſion, and right Order?</hi> Let him ſhew wherein our Commiſſion, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is defective, and reaſon would we ſhould hearken to him.</p>
               <p>But ſee the warineſſe, and ſlineſſe of the Examiner: <hi>I judge it not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeaſonable here, to entertaine the Diſpute of the true Power, and call of Chriſts Miniſtery.</hi> An handſome evaſion. Now when the grounds of his Separation are queſtioned, now when he ſtandeth upon his open juſtification, now in Print before the eyes of all men, now he thinketh it not ſeaſonable, to entertaine any diſpute of ſuch things at all. Thus <hi>Foelix</hi> would heare <hi>Paul</hi> when he had a more convenient time: and yet that was the very time and houre of his viſitation, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</p>
               <p>His evaſion of this Text in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. (by comparing it with <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12.) doth but adde a deluſion to an evaſion. [<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. I ſuppoſe he meaneth, though his printed copie ſay <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.] For it is a deluſion to make the capitall puniſhment preſcribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſumptuous rejection of the Sentence of the chiefeſt Court in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a figure of Excommunication in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:160232:121"/>
               <p>For firſt, no Scripture of old or new Teſtament giveth any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of any ſuch figure in this Law. And to make a judiciall Law a figure without ſome light from ſome Scripture, is to make a mans ſelfe, wiſe above that which is written.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That law is of morall equitie, that is of univerſall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall equitie, in all Nations, in all Ages: He that ſhall preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly appeale from, or riſe up againſt the ſentence of the chiefeſt and higheſt Court in a free State, is guilty <hi>Laeſae majeſtatis publicae,</hi> and therfore as a capitall offender to be cenſured in any free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. provided an effectuall puniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch preſumptuous offenders, and an effectuall remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch like preſumption in others, that <hi>all Iſrael might heare, and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly,</hi> ver. 13. But ſo doth not Excommunication. For what if an Excommunicate perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume againſt the ſentence of Chriſt in his Church, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> doth againſt the Sentence of the Church of <hi>Salem?</hi>) doth the power of the Church provide, that all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God may heare, and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly? Is the figure become more powerfull, and effectuall, then the ſubſtance? the ſhadow, then the body? the type, then the Antitype?</p>
               <p>From this miſtaken Figure, the Examiner would inferre, <hi>The withholding of the Corne preſumptuouſly to be death in Iſrael: but not ſo in every State of the world: much leſſe the pleading againſt a falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to be a capitall crime: for as for Baniſhment never ſuch a courſe was heard of in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That law in <hi>Deut.</hi> hath nothing to doe with the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Corne preſumptuouſly, unleſſe there had firſt paſſed ſome ſentence of the Soveraigne Court againſt the withholding of Corne. But otherwiſe ordinary ſinnes of preſumption, doe fall under the Judicature of another Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30, 31.</p>
               <p>Neither hath this Text in <hi>Solomons Proverbs</hi> any thing to doe with that Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. nor with capitall puniſhment. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſay, that every man that withholdeth his corne, ſhall be put to death in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> nor doe I ſay that he is to be put to death in any State of the world: leaſt of all doe I ſay that Pleading againſt a falſe Miniſtery is a capitall crime: Theſe are all but excurſions, and evaporations of the ſuperfluity of wit. But this I ſay, (and not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:160232:122"/>I but <hi>Solomon) He that withholdeth the Corne, the people ſhall curſe him,</hi> Prov. 11.26. And curſing implyeth Separation. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſhall withdraw, or ſeparate, the Corne from the people, or the people from the Corne; the people have juſt cauſe to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate either him from themſelves, or themſelves from him. And this proportion will hold as well in ſpirituall Corne as bodily: the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſtill ſtandeth unſhaken.</p>
               <p>What though we never read of Baniſhment in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> we read of ſomething proportionable: what elſe meaneth that Decree? <hi>Let Judgement be executed to death, or to Baniſhment,</hi> Ezra. 7.27. And <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.8? <hi>Let all his ſubſtance be forfeited, and himſelfe ſeparated from the Congregation of thoſe that had been carried away.</hi> And in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> frequent mention is made of, <hi>Cutting off from the people;</hi> which though in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it may ſometime ſignifie, cutting off by Gods hand, ſometime by the ſword of the Magiſtrate, and ſometime cutting off from the fellowſhip of Gods Houſe: yet in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, The cutting off (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14.) may very well reach, cutting off from their civill Cohabitation: as for a like offence <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and his mother were cut off from cohabitation in the Tents of <hi>Abrahams</hi> people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. to 14.</p>
               <p>Alſo he that had unawares ſlaine a man, was baniſhed, though not out of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet from his own Houſe, and Towne, and Tribe, till the death of the High Prieſt, and that was as much as Baniſhment out of any Society of Chriſts people now, whether in Church, or Civill Fellowſhip. For though out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was no full Baniſhment legally enjoyned, becauſe there was then no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church extant in the world, (and ſo to baniſh a man out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was as much as to ſay, Goe, and ſerve other Gods, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19) yet now when Church-fellowſhip in the true Religion may be had in ſo many places, to baniſh a man out of his Countrey, is no more then it was then to baniſh an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> into a Citie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. But though baniſhment be now a lawfull puniſhment in ſome caſe, yet I goe not about to prove that every wilfull withholding of corne, in every State is baniſhment, much leſſe death. But he that ſhall withhold his own corne, and goe about to perſwade all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have corne lying by them, to ſhut up their ſacks mouths, and not to bring forth their corne for the nouriſhment of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (which is, if we ſpeake of ſpirituall corne, the very caſe of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:160232:122"/>Examiner) I doe not ſee but ſuch an one may be juſtly accounted as <hi>Hoſtis Reipublicae,</hi> a publick enemy of the Countrey, and, as ſuch an one, in due order, to be caſt out of it.</p>
               <p>In due order I ſay; for if ſuch an one be detained from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his corne by ſome ſcruple of Conſcience, (as ſuppoſe a man able to Preach Chriſt, and ſo able to diſpenſe ſpirituall corne, yet doubting of the true way of the Miniſtery ſince the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, dare not practiſe the Miniſtery.) Such an one ſhould not be ſodainly caſt out of the Countrey, till he be firſt convinced, that the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, did never ſo farre prevaile againſt the Church of Chriſt, as to roote it out from off the face of the earth. The woman (which is the Church of Chriſt) was ſtill nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in a Wilderneſſe, even during all the Reigne of Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14, 15, 16. The Temple of God, (which is his Church) together with the Altar, and them that worſhip therein, were ſtill meaſured, and that by <hi>John</hi> (by Apoſtolick meaſure) all the time, when Antichriſt trod downe the outward Court of the holy City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1, 2. The Golden veſſels of the Temple ſtill continued in the middeſt of the Babyloniſh Captivitie. And if ſpirituall Babylon have now ſo farre prevailed againſt the Church of Chriſt, as that they have rooted it up from the face of the earth, then what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the promiſe of Chriſt; <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it?</hi> Mat. 16.18. Surely the Promiſe is given to a particular Congregationall Church, that it ſhall never faile, but ſhall alwayes be extant in ſome Countrey, or other; for he ſpeaks of ſuch a Church, to whom the keyes of the Kingdome are committed, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. It will be vaine to look for new Apoſtles to replant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the ruines of the Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie. For the new Teſtament acknowledgeth <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be the laſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. If any Apoſtles riſe up after them, then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> will not be the laſt. And when the New <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> comes downe from Heaven, yet ſhee ſhall not be builded by any new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but built upon that foundation which the Lambes twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have already laid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for thoſe many excellent, and worthy Gentlemen, Lawyers, Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and others, whom the Examiner commendeth to be as well gifted in the knowledge of the Scripture, and furniſhed with gifts, of tongues, and utterance, as moſt that profeſſe the Miniſtery, and yet are not perſwaded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:160232:123"/>to ſell ſpirituall Corne, as queſtioning their true calling, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch a caſe I would firſt ſeeke (by the helpe of Chriſt) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſcruples upon which they queſtion their calling, and Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I would thinke it meet, to put a difference between ſuch as never received a lawfull calling and commiſſion to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and them that have received it. But if any of them have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a lawfull calling into the Miniſtery, and yet will neither Preach themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would, I ſuppoſe that both Church, and Common-wealth, may juſtly account them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any Chriſtian ſociety; and as ſuch unprofitable ſervants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to miniſter themſelves, or to ſuffer others to miniſter ſpirituall things; ſo others ſhould refuſe to miniſter to them carnall things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſelling, or withholding of ſpirituall Corne, are both of a ſpirituall nature: and therefore muſt neceſſarily in a true Paralell beare Relation to a ſpirituall Curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they that miniſter ſpirituall good things may duely reape carnall good things, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.) then they that hinder the miniſtring of ſpirituall good things, may juſtly reape the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of enjoyment of carnall good things. What if ſpirituall, and carnall good things be not paralell? Are there no Arguments but <hi>a Pari?</hi> Is it not lawfull reaſoning <hi>a majori ad minus?</hi> If men hinder the enjoyment of ſpirituall good things, may they not be hindred from the enjoyment of that which is leſſe, carnall good things? It would weary a ſober minde to purſue ſuch windy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: though I hope the Lord will helpe me not to count it weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, either to ſatisfie a tender Conſcience, or to convince a Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For I did not alledge that place of Scripture, as a ground upon which the Court proceeded to his Baniſhment: and therefore I ſaid in my Letter, it may be they paſſed Sentence not upon that ground.

               <p>IN the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> examineth thoſe words of my Letter, wherein I ſay, that <hi>were my ſoule in his ſoules ſtead, I ſhould accept it as a mercy of God, to baniſh me from the Civill Society of ſuch a Common-wealth, where I could not enjoy holy Fellowſhip with any Church of God amongst them without ſinne. For what ſhould the daughter of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:160232:124"/>Zion doe in Babel? Why ſhould ſhee not haſten to flee from thence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Examiner anſwereth, that <hi>though his love bids him to hope, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>herein intended him a Cordiall, yet if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients be examined, there will appeare no leſſe then diſhonour to the Name of God, danger to every Civill State, a miſerable comfort to him, and a contradiction within it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true, what I wrote was in love to his ſoule: but I intended not a cordiall of conſolation to him, (for I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Spirit at the preſent prepared for it;) but I intended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a conviction, to abate the rigour of his indignation againſt the diſpenſation of divine Juſtice: And therefore preſented before him the mercy of God in that Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>But he beginneth with the laſt, firſt, to ſhew me the evill of theſe Ingredients.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the contradiction to my ſelfe, in <hi>that I ſpeake of the daughter of Zion in Babel: If he call</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Land Babel, how can it be Babel, and the Church of Chriſt alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if <hi>Zion</hi> cannot be in <hi>Babel,</hi> but it muſt be <hi>Babel?</hi> or as if the Church cannot be in the world, but it muſt be the world? Or as if when I call the Land <hi>Babel,</hi> I ſpeake of it as it is in it ſelfe, and not rather as it is in his apprehenſion? the Churches (in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination) ſtill holding communion with Antichriſtian <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He maketh it a dangerous Doctrine to affirme it, <hi>a miſery to live in that State where a Chriſtian cannot enjoy the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the publick Churches of God without ſinne.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Though I doe affirme it to be a mercy to be delivered out of ſuch a State, yet I doe not affirme it to be a miſery to live in it. It is a mercy to be tranſlated, not onely from miſery to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but from a leſſe good to a greater. It is a mercy to a faithfull ſoule to be tranſlated from a Saint to a Miniſter; and yet Saintſhip is no miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>What if God commanded his people to Pray for the Peace of materiall Babel, whileſt they were forced to abide in it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it not therefore a mercy from God, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deliver them out of <hi>Babel?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> True; but what is that to the purpoſe? The Queſtion is if I could not enjoy the Fellowſhip of publick Churches without ſinne, (as in thoſe dayes I could not) whether then I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a mercy to be removed?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Examiner is falſly, and foully miſ-informed, when he ſaith, <hi>I was about to ſeparate ſome few yeares ſince from the new Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:160232:125"/>Churches as Legall.</hi> For I never counted them as Legall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; nor was I ever about to ſeparate from them as Legall, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſo uncleane, that a good conſcience might not hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them without ſinne.</p>
               <p>The truth is, There was a Generation of Familiſts in our own, and other Townes, who under pretence of holding forth, what I had taught, touching union with Chriſt, and evidencing of that union, did ſecretly vent ſundry corrupt, and dangerous errors, and hereſies, denying all inherent righteouſneſſe, and all evidencing of a good eſtate thereby in any ſort, and ſome of them denying alſo the Immortalitie of the ſoule, and Reſurrection of the body. When they were queſtioned by ſome Brethren about thoſe things, they carried it as if they held forth nothing but what they had received from me. Whereof when I was advertiſed, to cleare my ſelfe, I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Preached againſt theſe errors. Then ſaid the Brethren to the erring party, See, your Teacher declares himſelfe clearely to differ from you. No matter (ſay the other) what he ſaith in publick, we underſtand him otherwiſe, and we know what he ſaith to us in private. Yea and I my ſelfe could not eaſily beleeve that thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Brethren, and Siſters were ſo corrupt in their Judgements, as they were reported, they ſeeming to me forward Chriſtians, and utterly denying unto me any ſuch Tenents, or any thing elſe but what they received from my ſelfe. All which bred in ſundry of the Countrey a jealouſie that I was in ſecret a Fomenter of the Spirit of Familiſme, if not leavened my ſelfe that way. Which I diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it wrought in me thoughts, (as it did in many other ſincerely godly Brethren of our Church) not of a Separation from the Churches, as Legall, (whom we truely embraced, and honoured in the Lord) but of a Remoovall to <hi>New Haven,</hi> as being better knowne to the Paſtor, and ſome others there, then to ſuch as were at that time jealous of me here. The true Ground whereof was, an inward loathneſſe to be troubleſome to godly mindes, and a feare of the unprofitableneſſe of my Miniſtery there, where my way was ſuſpected to be doubtfull, and dangerous. I choſe therefore rather to meditate a ſilent departure in Peace, then by tarrying here to make way for the breaking forth of Temptations. But when at the Synod I had diſcovered the corruption of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the erring Brethren, and ſaw their fraudulent pretence of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:160232:125"/>holding forth no other, but what they received from me, (when as indeed they pleaded for groſſe errors, contrary to my judgement;) and thereupon bare witneſſe againſt them; and when in a private conference with ſome chiefe Magiſtrates, and Elders, I perceived that my purpoſe of removall upon ſuch differences was unwelcome to them, and that ſuch Points needed not to occaſion any diſtance (neither in place, nor in heart) amongſt Brethren, I then reſted ſatisfied in my abode amongſt them, and ſo have continued by the Grace of Chriſt unto this day.</p>
               <p>But now to returne to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his Queſtion; <hi>In the time of this Difference, would I count it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a mercy to be pluckt up by the rovtes, me, and mine, and to endure the loſſes, diſtractions, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that doe attend ſuch a condition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea truely, if thoſe jealouſies, and differences had ſtill held, I ſhould have accounted it, and then did account it a mercy to ſee a doore open for remoovall. And therefore in my heart choſe it, and purpoſed it, as a way of wiſdome, and mercy.</p>
               <p>But whereas he talketh of plucking up by the rootes, the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor is too Catachreſticall. An old Tree pluckt up by the rootes is not like to grow againe: but neither he, nor I, was expoſed to ſuch an Eradication: we might have remooved (with our ſelves) whatſoever mooveables we had; and what we could not remoove, we might put it off (ſooner, or later) unto others for a valuable conſideration. So that though wee had been plucked up by the rootes, our rootes had not been dried up, but would have ſprung forth againe to our comfortable ſupportance.</p>
               <p>It is a queſtion altogether impertinent, which the Examiner put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the next place, <hi>Whether if the Inhabitants in</hi> New-England <hi>were permitted to enjoy in</hi> Old-England <hi>their Congregationall way, whether then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>himſelfe (if be were ſeated in</hi> Old England <hi>againe) would count it a mercy to be baniſhed from the Civill State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that is not at all the Queſtion in hand, but this: whether if there were no Congregationall Churches in <hi>Old-England,</hi> unto which we might joyne without ſinne, whether then it were a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be thruſt out? And verily for my ſelfe (and I doubt not for many a thouſand more) I ſhould account is a mercy, to be haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, yea, (if I lingred) to be thruſt out in ſuch a caſe. If many thouſand godly perſons in this Countrey did not make the ſame
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:160232:126"/>account, how came we to dwell here, as we doe this day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither yet doe I make God the Author of ſuch cruell mercy, in them that were the cauſes of our caſting out, as he calumniateth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Inſtruments of any unjuſt dealing with the ſervants of God may be cruell: when yet the hand of God in ordering ſuch a worke may be moſt mercifull. The hand of God was moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in caſting him out of his Fathers houſe into Aegypt, when yet the hand of his brethren was defiled with bloud-guiltie cruelty.</p>
               <p>When the Examiner concludeth, that <hi>if I had been expoſed to the miſeries, poverties, neceſſities, wants, debts, hardſhips of Sea and Land, in a baniſhed Condition, he preſumeth I would reach forth a more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cordiall to the afflicted; and therefore looketh at himſelfe afflicted, as a Lampe deſpiſed in the eyes of him that is at eaſe,</hi> Job 12.5.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Lord might be pleaſed to open his eyes by ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, wiſely to conſider whether he be not out of his way, when he meeteth with ſuch miſeries, poverties, debts, hardſhips? Surely when God hedgeth in the way of his people with thornes, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to returne to their firſt husband, for then it was better with them, then now, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. His baniſhment was doubtleſſe no cauſe of ſuch afflictions: Divers others have been caſt out of the Countrey, as well as he, and yet God hath generally reſcued them from affliction, &amp; proſpered their eſtates before his eyes. But when he chooſeth rather to betake himſelfe to merchandiſe by Land and Sea, (unto which he was never brought up) then to ſerve the Lord, and his People in diſpenſing ſpirituall food to them in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, no marvell if the Lord doe not ſhine upon his way, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to debts, neceſſities, poverties, miſeries, hardſhips by Sea and Land. It is farre off from me to deſpiſe his afflicted condition: but the trueſt mercifull cordiall to his afflicted eſtate, would be to perſwade him that he is out of his way, and ſtill bleſſeth himſelfe (though God both croſſe his eſtate, and blaſt his ſpirit) in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p>As for my being at eaſe, (as he calleth it) had he been a little longer acquainted with the faithfull diſcharge of a Miniſters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he would not judge it ſuch a ſtate of eaſe. If I durſt allow my ſelfe to ſeeke, and take mine eaſe, I ſhould ſooner chooſe a private ſolitary condition in his Wilderneſſe, then all the throng of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in this numerous ſociety.</p>

               <p>In theſe lines, the Examiner telleth us, <hi>an humble, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit may eſpie, firſt, a glorious juſtification, and boaſting of my ſelfe, and others concurring with me: ſecondly, an unrighteous, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cenſure of the afflicted.</hi>

Let the light of the holy word of God diſcover, and judge, whether the ſword of the mouth of the Lord Jeſus be found in his mouth, and his fellowes, or in the mouths of the Churches, and Brethren here: and let the tryall be upon this very Point, whether witneſſeth for Chriſt, or for Antichriſt?</p>
               <p n="1">1. We witneſſe that Chriſt was never ſo farre overthrowne, and overcome by Antichriſt, but that ſtill the Lord Jeſus hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Congregationall Church, one or more, eſpecially ſince the Reformation of Religion, by the Miniſtery of <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Miniſters of Chriſt in the dayes of our Fathers.</p>
               <p>The Examiner witneſſeth, that ſince the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, Antichriſt hath ſo farre prevailed againſt Chriſt, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he hath no Church, nor Church-Officers left upon the face of the earth to this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee witneſſe the godly perſons, viſible Saints, confeſſing their knowne ſinnes, and profeſſing their faith, are fit materialls for Church-fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>The Examiner witneſſeth, that the Churches (which conſiſt of ſuch viſible Saints) are nullities, unleſſe they diſcerne every ſpot, and pollution of Antichriſt, and forſake it: (for Inſtance) unleſſe they ſee the Antichriſtian pollution of the Miniſtery in <hi>England,</hi> and doe refuſe to heare the word from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We witneſſe, that Perſons qualified with a convenient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſpirituall gifts, fit to lead Gods people; and choſen, and elected by a Congregation of viſible Saints, and ordained, and ſet apart unto the worke of the Miniſtery, have received a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Chriſt to that office.</p>
               <p>The Examiner witneſſeth againſt this as a falſe Calling, upon what pretence himſelfe better knowes then I.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We witneſſe, that it is lawfull for the King of <hi>England,</hi> to give a Patent to a certain number of his Subjects, to tranſplant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> and to poſſeſſe ſuch Lands as the Providence of God layeth open before them, between ſuch, and ſuch Degrees of the Horizon. Provided that his Subjects adventure not upon ſuch acts as the Patent never intended, as to murther the Natives, or to diſpoſſeſſe them by violence or fraud of their lawfull
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:160232:127"/>Poſſeſſions: but either to plant themſelves in a <hi>vacuum Domicilium,</hi> or if they ſit downe upon the Poſſeſſion of the Natives, to receive the ſame from them by a reaſonable Purchaſe, or free Aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Examiner witneſſeth againſt all ſuch Patents, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be unlawfull for Magiſtrates to execute Juſtice upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by them, and that it is neceſſary to repent of receiving ſuch Patents, and to returne them back againe into the hands of thoſe Princes, or of their Succeſſors, from whom they received them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We witneſſe, that it is lawfull for Magiſtrates (eſpecially in time of danger) to offer to the Subjects under them an Oath of Fidelity, whether they be regenerate, or unregenerate.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> witneſſeth it to be utterly unlawfull ſo to doe: an Oath for confirmation of Office being peculiar to Chriſt: and an Oath being a worſhip of God not meete for unregenerate Perſons to take into their mouths.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wee witneſſe, that if a Church refuſe to hearken to the voyce of Magiſtrates in delaying the Election, or ordination of ſuch an one to Office, whom they finde to be troubleſome to the State, then it may be lawfull for Magiſtrates to delay the granting of the Petition of ſuch a Church for Lands that lie convenient for them.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> witneſſeth, that in ſuch a caſe the Church, whoſe Petition is ſo delayed, may write Letters of Admonition to all the Churches, whereof ſuch Magiſtrates are members, to require them to grant without delay ſuch Petitions, or elſe to Proceed againſt them in a Church-way.</p>
               <p>Now let the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Saints on earth judge, in whether ſort of theſe witneſſes, the word, and Spirit of Chriſt, or Antichriſt breatheth. As for the deciphering which the Examiner maketh of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cotton, as ſwimming with the ſtreame of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward credit, and profit, and ſmiting with the fiſt, and ſword of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as doe not joyne in worſhip with him.</hi> I cannot ſay that I have ſworn, but I thanke God I have waded through credit, and diſcredit, through evill report, and good report, as a deceiver, and yet true. And for profit, I have neither abounded in ſuperfluities, nor (through mercy) have been long deſtitute of neceſſaries: but whether this be a badge of Antichriſt, and not compatible to the witneſſes of Chriſt, I have not yet learned.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:160232:128"/>
               <p>And for ſmiting with the fiſt, and ſword of Perſecution, if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution be affliction for Righteouſneſſe ſake, I would willingly learne of the Examiner, whom of all the Righteous I have ſmitten with the fiſt, or wounded with the ſword? I ſpeake according to his own meaning, meaning (as I ſuppoſe himſelfe doth) neither bodily fiſt, nor materiall ſword; but let him then Inſtance in ſome one, or other, that hath felt the heavineſſe of my fiſt, or the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my ſword, or elſe let him remember what the Spirit of God hath ſaid (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.18.) concerning ſuch, as ſpeake bitter things proudly, and contemptuouſly, (and I alſo adde) injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and falſely againſt thoſe whom himſelfe in the next line ſtyleth <hi>holy, and beloved.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Court being held within twelve or fourteene miles diſtance from <hi>Salem,</hi> travell to, and fro, was no likely cauſe of ſuch diſtemper. And whatſoever his Labours were in Towne or Field, on the Lords Dayes, or weeke dayes, (I detract not from them;) but this is all I would ſay, That that ſodaine diſtemper fell not upon him, neither in the field at his labour, nor on the weeke dayes, or Lords dayes in his Preaching: but in his vehement publick arguing againſt the writings, and teſtimonies of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Brethren ſent to him, and to the Church of <hi>Salem,</hi> againſt his corrupt wayes. Wherein though I know, <hi>All things fall alike to all:</hi> yet if <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe (as well as <hi>Balaam</hi>) meet with a check in his journey from the hand of God, I beleeve it is a juſt call to conſider; Is there not a lye in my right hand? Or is there not an Idol in my heart? or doe I goe about the worke of God, in a way of God? Howſoever, it was farre from me to upbraide your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (as your marginall note taxeth;) but rather to call you to conſider of your unprofitable, and perverſe uſe of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of his Anſwer is a Recrimination of the <hi>Officer
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:160232:128"/>of Juſtice, by whom in this time he was unmercifully driven from his Chamber to a winters flight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>in this time;</hi> if he meane (as the words foregoing expreſſe) the time wherein he was neere unto death, it is a manifeſt untruth.
<note place="margin">James Bonne</note> For the Officer of Juſtice (who then was) is a man fearing God, and of a tender Conſcience, and who dare not allow that liberty to his tongue, which the Examiner often uſeth in this Diſcourſe: He teſtifieth, he then ſpake with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> and that he diſcerned no ſigne of ſickneſſe upon him, much leſſe of neerneſſe unto death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He teſtifieth further, that upon the mourning complaint of ſome of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> his neighbours, who did adhere to him, he left onely the Warrant with him, but left him in his houſe to take the time for his departure limited in his warrant, which was not that night, though he doe not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how many dayes were ſet him. But this I have been given to underſtand, that the increaſe of concourſe of people to him on the Lords dayes in private, to the neglect or deſerting of publick Ordinances, and to the ſpreading of the Leaven of his corrupt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, provoked the Magiſtrates rather then to breed a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpirituall plague in the Countrey, to put upon him a winters journey out of the Countrey. <hi>Gangraenam amoveas, no pars ſincera trahatur.</hi>

               <p>TO his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, I ſhall not need to returne any large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Let him read over my words againe, which he examineth, and anſwereth in this Chapter, and they may ſerve for a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto his Anſwer, ſo farre as it is needfull.</p>
               <p>Onely let me touch a Paſſage, or two. When he ſaith, <hi>That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt manifeſtation of the countenance of God, reconciled in the bloud of Chriſt unto his ſoule, it hath been with him, as with one whom he ſaith, I told him off, his Queſtions, and Troubles have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Reconciliation, and Peace with God, but concerning Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would it might pleaſe the Lord to perſwade his heart, that, that one of whom I ſpake to him, was but one to whom the Lord
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:160232:129"/>diſpenſed himſelfe in that manner; and he a man, though he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much, and wrote much, yet no where magnified his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor vilified the Authors of his ſufferings: A man that cleaved to the Ordinances, and Saints of God, and not willing to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his diſſent from his Brethren, no not there where he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as willing to attribute more to the judgements of other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, then to arrogate to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But ſurely the ordinary manner of Gods diſpenſation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his ſervants, is otherwiſe; even to thoſe that have been moſt precious in his ſight. <hi>Job</hi> hath ſometimes complained, that <hi>God tooke him for his enemy,</hi> Job 13.24.26. <hi>David</hi> ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, that <hi>he was cut off from before Gods eyes,</hi> Pſal. 31.22. And that God ſometimes <hi>hid his face from him,</hi> Pſal. 30.7. That his ſoule was alſo <hi>ſore vexed</hi> with the ſence of Gods anger, and <hi>hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,</hi> Pſal. 6.1. 3 <hi>Aſaph</hi> alſo complaineth of the ſame, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. and <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. If the Lord have dealt more indulgently with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> he hath the more cauſe to walke humbly, and circumſpectly, and fruitfully before the Lord, which is the worſt that I wiſh him. And let him alſo conſider, that whileſt he liveth under the Sunne, himſelfe is not exempted from the dangerous Inmate of a deceitfull heart. As for Maſter <hi>Smith</hi> he ſtandeth, and falleth to his own Maſter: whileſt he was Preacher to the Citie of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> he wrought with God then: what temptations befell him after, by the evill work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of evill men, and ſome good men too, I chooſe rather to tremble at, then diſcourſe of. If I had made uſe of his Principles, and Arguments, (as this Examiner ſaith I have) it is more then my ſelfe know: for I have not been acquainted with ſundry of his writings, as being diſcouraged with that one, wherein he maketh Originall ſinne an idle name.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:160232:129"/>which I was mooved to ſpeake even now, that the Examiner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth more liberty to his tongue, then the Meſſenger of Juſtice, a man of a tender Conſcience, (of whom I ſpake) durſt uſe. But when a man is delivered up to Satan, and neither his minde, nor conſcience, nor tongue, nor pen, are his own, no marvell if he caſt forth fire-brands, and arrowes, and mortall things, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Publican, or Pagan would hardly utter, without ſome more colourable pretence then the Examiner hath to ſay, <hi>That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>is of opinion, that it is lawfull to commit a treacherous ſlaughter of the Saints, whom we are forced to call,</hi> Beloved in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THe reſidue of my Letter to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> was taken up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooving two ſtumbling blocks out of his way, which turned him off from fellowſhip with us. The former was, the want of fit matter of our Churches. The latter, our diſreſpect to the ſeparate Churches in <hi>England.</hi> Our want of fit matter he acknowledged ſtood, not in this, that <hi>we wanted godly perſons to be the viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Churches, (for with joy, he acknowledgeth that:) but in this, that all godly perſons are not matter fit to conſtitute a Church, no more then Trees, or Quarries are fit matter proportioned to a Building.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This exception of his ſeemed to me to imply a contradiction: <hi>for if the matter of our Churches were (ſuch as himſelfe acknowledged) godly perſons, they were not then as Trees unfeld, nor as ſtones in the Quarry unhewen: for godlineſſe cutteth men downe from their former roote, and heweth them out of the Pit of corrupt Nature, and fitteth them for fellowſhip with Chriſt, and with his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of his Anſwer is (though delivered in other words obſcurely and confuſedly, yet in ſence) thus much; That he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth our members, as Trees or Quarries, not for that they are not yet cut our of the pit or roote of naturall corruption, but for that they are not yet removed and clenſed from actuall and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. He may doe well to conſider, that the moſt of thoſe Saints he nameth, were not as rude Trees and Quarries unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Building, but as Trees of Righteouſneſſe, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Stones, layed by God himſelfe in the Building of his Church. But I eaſily grant him, that according to the Diſcipline of the Churches of Chriſt in the dayes of the Goſpel, it were meete that godly perſons falling into any groſſe, and ſcandalous, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pollution, they ſhould firſt give ſatisfaction to the Church by profeſſion of their Repentance, before they be received into holy fellowſhip with the Lord, and his People, in Church-communion. In which reſpect, if Chriſt be conſidered as head of the viſible Church, he who is a member of the Church, (and ſo a member of Chriſt) may fall ſo foully into groſſe ſinne, and be ſo enthralled to it, as to be ſeparate from the Church, yea and from Chriſt too, conſidered as the viſible head of it. <hi>And therefore the Examiner miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelfe, and me too, when he writeth, that I affirmed, that godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot be ſo enthralled to Antichriſt, as to ſeparate them from Chriſt.</hi> For I never denied, that godly perſons may fall, as into other groſſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:160232:130"/>and notorious ſinnes; ſo alſo into groſſe and notorious Antichriſtian Pollutions, ſo as to ſeparate them from Church-Communion, yea and from Chriſt himſelfe, as he is the Head of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. But to cleare the point more fully and plainly; Put the caſe, that the Saints whom the Examiner ſetteth forth in their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, (as <hi>Noah, Abraham, Lot, Sampſon, Job, David, Peter,</hi>) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay, they had openly profeſſed their Repentance for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſcandalls, of drunkenneſſe, lying, inceſt, murder, &amp;c. and all their other knowne ſcandalls, but had neither diſcerned nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled the ſinne of Polygamy: yea, ſuppoſe the Church with which they might joyne, did neither diſcerne the neceſſitie, nor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of acknowledging that ſinne, whether ſuch Saints were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from Church-communion, (as rude Trees and Quarries?) or if they were received as members into the Church, whether was ſuch a Church to be ſeparated from? If yea, we muſt look for new Rules for it out of a new Goſpel. If no, then will the Examiner want a Rule for his ſeparation from all the Churches in <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this is the very ſtate of the Queſtion, as the Examiner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rehearſeth it, in this Chapter. For he having objected, that <hi>a neceſſitie lieth upon godly men, before they can be fit matter for Church-fellowſhip, to ſee, bewaile, repent, and come out of the falſe Churches, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Miniſtery, Government,</hi> (<hi>according to Scriptures,</hi> Iſai. 62.11. 2 Cor. 6.17.) <hi>And this to be done, not by a locall remoovall, but by a deliverance of the ſoule, underſtanding, will, judgement and affection, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſubjoyneth my Anſwer out of my Letter in theſe words;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We grant, that it is not locall remoovall from former pollution, nor contrary practiſe, that fitteth us for fellowſhip with Chriſt, and his Church: but that it is neceſſary alſo, that we doe repent of ſuch former Pollutions, wherewith we have been defiled and enthralled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We grant further, that it is neceſſary to Church-fellowſhip, that we ſhou'd ſee and diſcerne all ſuch pollutions, as doe ſo farre enthrall us to Antichriſt, as to ſeparate us from Chriſt. But this we profeſſe unto you, that wherein we have reformed our practiſe, therein we have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unfainedly to humble our ſoules for our former contrary walking. If any through hypocriſie are wanting herein, the hidden hypocriſie of ſome will not prejudice the ſinceritie, and faithfulneſſe of others, nor the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This though the Examiner doe rehearſe it here in this Chapter:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:160232:131"/>yet here he anſwereth nothing to it, though it be the very hinge of the Controverſie. If we meet with any Anſwer to it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele, we ſhall (God willing) conſider of it in its place.</p>
               <p>Onely let me adde this third thing to cleare the ſtate of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie more fully, That to this day we doe not ſee nor diſcerne, that it is any Antichriſtian pollution at all, for a member of any of our Churches, going over into <hi>England,</hi> to heare the word Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a well-gifted Miniſter in the Pariſh Aſſemblies.</p>

               <p>To his ſecond Argument I would therefore Anſwer, that as an holy Altar and Temple to God, could not have been built to God in the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the Builders muſt come locally out of <hi>Babel</hi> to build it in <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> So a Church of Chriſt cannot be built to God, but by ſuch Builders as ſpiritually come out of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian pollutions and inventions, at leaſt out of ſuch pollutions as keepe them ſtill in <hi>Babel,</hi> and detaine them under Antichriſt, and ſeparate them from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To his third Argument, I would grant all that he ſaith in it to be true: But how he applieth it to inferre his concluſion, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſeth, nor is it eaſie for me to gather. If his meaning be,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:160232:131"/>that <hi>Luther,</hi> and other godly perſons, might not be received into Church-fellowſhip in thoſe dayes, becauſe they ſaw not the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe gulfe of all thoſe Antichriſtian corruptions, which the Lord hath ſince diſcovered; It is a concluſion that I durſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, nor will he be ever able to make good. It is not alwayes full Moone in reſpect of ſpirituall light with every Church of God in all ages alike.</p>
               <p>To his fourth Argument, taken from my own Practiſe; <hi>In that I doe not receive all Perſons, eminent for Grace and godlineſſe, forthwith to the fellowſhip of the Lords Supper, till upon their entrance into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with a Confeſſion of faith, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would anſwer, it is not becauſe I thinke ſuch perſons are not fit matter for Church eſtate; but becauſe they yet want a fit Forme, requiſite to Church-eſtate.</p>
               <p>His laſt Argument, is taken from a <hi>famous Paſſage</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>of a ſolemne Queſtion put to me, and to the other New-Engliſh Elders, unto which I with the reſt did anſwer Negatively, That if godly perſons coming over hither did refuſe to ſubmit to our way of worſhip and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that then they could not onely not enjoy Church-fellowſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but not be permitted to breath and live in the ſame common ayre and Common-wealth together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer; 1. That it is ſuitable to his wonted bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to affirme that of me which is more then he knoweth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more then is truth. For though he ſay, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and the New Engliſh Elders returned that Anſwer: yet the anſwer to that Queſtion, and to all the other thirty-two Queſtions, were drawne up by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mader,</hi> and neither drawne up nor ſent by me, nor (for ought I know) by the other Elders here, though publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of our Elders there. Howſoever, the ſubſtance of that Anſwer (not which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> rehearſeth, but which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mader</hi> returned) doth generally ſuite with all our mindes, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular; The Anſwer which our reverend and beloved brother M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mader</hi> did returne unto that Queſtion, I have read it, and did readily approve it (as I doe the ſubſtance of all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers) to be judicious, and ſolide. But this I muſt needs profeſſe, that his Anſwer to this Queſtion is notoriouſly ſlandered, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the Examiner.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:160232:132"/>
               <p>For 1. There is no word at all in that Anſwer, <hi>that denieth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſuch godly perſons to live and breath in the ſame ayre of the Common-wealth.</hi> Let the Anſwer be peruſed; It is too long for me to tranſcribe; the Book is publiquely extant, and obvious: and ſee if there be a ſyllable ſounding that way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that Anſwer he diſtinguiſheth (out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Parker</hi>) touching matters of Church Diſcipline, and maketh ſome to be the ſubſtantiall and immutable, others of a more acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and circumſtantiall nature.</p>
               <p>In the former, <hi>he doubteth not but that we and all the godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in</hi> England <hi>ſhould accord (if they were here;) as beleeving, that either we ſhould ſatisfie them in our way, or they us in theirs; ſo as there would never be Queſtion, whether we ſhould embrace one another as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter, to wit, in matters circumſtantiall, we are all taught of God, <hi>Placide ferre aliud ſentientes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Examiner maketh it his own caſe, <hi>not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to live and breath in the ſame ayre and Common-wealth, though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton, <hi>and others, moſt incenſed, gave him a teſtimony of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let him be pleaſed to look back, to what hath been formerly laid open, and he will finde this Inſtance of himſelfe wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. For the caſting of him out of the Common-wealth, ſprung not from his difference in matters of Church Diſcipline. It was well knowne that whileſt he lived at <hi>Salem,</hi> he neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor permitted any Church-members, but ſuch as rejected all Communion with the Pariſh Aſſemblies, ſo much as in hearing of the Word amongſt them. And this libertie he did uſe and might have uſed to this day, without any diſturbance to his Civill or Church-Peace, (ſave onely in a way of brotherly diſquiſition;) but it was his Doctrines and Practiſes which tended to the Civill diſturbance of the Common-wealth, together with his heady and buſie purſuite of the ſame, even to the rejection of all Churches here. Theſe they were that made him unfit for enjoying Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion either in the one ſtate, or in the other. When he reckoneth me, and me onely by name, (as one of the moſt incenſed againſt him) I reckon it as one of his uſuall exorbitant Hyperboles: unleſſe by <hi>Incenſed,</hi> he meane one that with ſome others, were moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:160232:132"/>and ſtirred up to endeavour his ſatisfaction. And then his terme <hi>Incenſed,</hi> though it be not an Hyperbole, yet it is an Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remember, that he hath any cauſe to ſay, that <hi>I gave him a Teſtimony of godlineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his godlineſſe, I leave it to him who is the ſearcher of hearts: I neither atteſted it, nor denied it.</p>
               <p>Every brother in the Church, though he may be called a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, as Chriſt is the Head of the viſible Church: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out of the Church, though he may be admoniſhed as a Brother, and ſo have ſome reference ſtill to Chriſt, yet godlineſſe requiteth a Participation of the Divine Nature, (I ſpeake in <hi>Peters</hi> ſence, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) by the power of the Spirit of Grace, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to fellowſhip with Chriſt, and his Churches: the which things have not ſo evidently appeared to me, (I ſpeak it with griefe) either in his ſpirit, or in his way theſe many yeares. And yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, others may diſcerne more Power of Godlineſſe in him, then I doe, and may ſpeake of him accordingly. But it was no uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſpeech of <hi>Paul,</hi> to tell the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and that before all the Churches, that he ſtood in feare of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10.

               <head>TO CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>HIs 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter is taken up in Examining and Anſwering a ſpeech of mine, <hi>That godly perſons are not ſo enthralled to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as to ſeparate from Chriſt: Elſe they could not be godly perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Anſwer is, <hi>That this cometh not neere the Queſtion, which is not concernign perſonall godlineſſe, or Grace in Chriſt, but the godlineſſe or Chriſtianitie of worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:160232:133"/>
               <p>Whereupon he diſtinguiſheth of Chriſt, as conſidered two waies: 1. <hi>Perſonally, as God-man, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>As Head of his Church. In the former ſence (he acknowledgeth) they cannot be ſo enthralled to Antichriſt, as to be ſeparate from Chriſt: in the latter they may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This diſtinction of Chriſt is inconveniently expreſſed, as was the like once before. For the <hi>membra dividentia,</hi> the parts of the diviſion are coincident. Chriſt as God-man is the Head of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. But his meaning I apprehend, and accept. Chriſt God-man is Head both of the inviſible Church, and of the viſible; As he is Head of the inviſible Church, ſo he is received by faith: As he is head of the viſible, ſo he is received by profeſſion of the true faith, both of the grace of faith, and of the Doctrine of faith. The proper fruit whereof is holy worſhip, and profeſſed ſubjection to the Rule of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now for his application of his Diſtinction, in the generall I doe approve it, and doe willingly acknowledge, that a godly perſon may be (through ignorance, or negligence) ſo farre enthralled to Antichriſt, as to be ſeparate from Chriſt, taking Chriſt as Head of the viſible Church. For he may fall into ſuch fundamentall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian corruption, in Doctrine, or Worſhip, or Government, as either may juſtly prevent his admiſſion into the Church, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, and yet (through pang of Temptation) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing obſtinate in his corruption after conviction, he may juſtly be excommunicate out of the Church. But leſt I may ſeeme to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (and ſo to vaniſh) in Generalities, whileſt I onely ſpeake of Antichriſtian corruptions in generall: I ſhall willingly Inſtance in ſome Particulars, which may give light to others of like nature. It is an Antichriſtian corruption in Doctrine, to accept any Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifices for our reconciliation, but the death of Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>It is a like corruption, to look for Juſtification from ſinne in the ſight of God by our own works.</p>
               <p>It is an Antichriſtian corruption in worſhip, to worſhip Angels, or Saints, or Images.</p>
               <p>It is an Antichriſtian corruption in Government, to take the Pope to be the Head of the Church: and ſuch an Head as hath Power to make Laws to binde the Conſcience, to authorize Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Canonicall, to adde other Books to Scripture with like Authoritie, to be himſelfe the onely Authenticall Interpreter of Scripture, and Judge of Controverſies.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:160232:133"/>
               <p>Theſe and the like corruptions are ſuch as make Antichriſt a Sonne of Perdition, and them that are led by him to fall into like Perdition with him. Of one of theſe Points <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, They that hold it, hold not the Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. Of another of theſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, They that hold it are aboliſhed from Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. The like wee may ſay of all the reſt. Yet in times of former darkneſſe, ſome of the faithfull members of Chriſt, might and were for a time entangled with a yoke of Bondage, in ſome, or moſt, or all of theſe Particulars: out of which the Lord at length reſcued them by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Temptations, and by ſome breaking forth of light in the mouths of ſome of his witneſſes in every age.</p>
               <p>But whileſt any of them walked in theſe, or like corruptions, they might juſtly be debarred from admiſſion into Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: or ſtanding faſt in them after conviction, they might juſtly be caſt forth out of Church-fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>But there be other corruptions, and Antichriſtian corruptions too, which becauſe they doe not ſubvert the Foundation, neither of faith, nor of Church-order, I would not ſay that they ſeparate from Chriſt, no not as he is the Head of the viſible Church. For then if ſome whole Church were leavened with them, they might ſoone ceaſe to be a Church. But we ſee the contrary in Scripture, the High Places were tolerated in <hi>Judah,</hi> and yet <hi>Judah</hi> ceaſed not to be a Church: And by like proportion ſome more high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Power may be given by ſome Churches to their Officers, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an Antichriſtian Patterne in ſome meaſure) and yet they not ceaſe to be a Church. <hi>David</hi> and all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might bring up the Arke of God in a Cart, (after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi>) and yet not diſanull their Church-eſtate: And by like proportion, ſo may a Church of Chriſt take up ſome orders, (as the carting of ſome part of their worſhip upon a Book) after the manner of Antichriſt, and yet not forthwith evacuate their Church-eſtate.</p>
               <p>But this let me further adde, that a godly perſon may have ſome kinde of communion, ſo farre as hearing the word from a Miniſter well gifted by Chriſt, to whoſe calling ſome corruption may cleave, both in his Church-eſtate, and in his Ordination: And yet nevertheleſſe, no Antichriſtian Pollution at all may cleave or redound to the hearer by his hearing of him. And this being the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:160232:134"/>Principall Exception w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Examiner taketh againſt ſome of the members of our churches, &amp; againſt all the churches for their ſakes, we ſhall further (God willing) cleare when the Examiner putteth it upon us in the ſequele. Meane while, we profeſſe as we doe beleeve, that ſuch an action is not any Church-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Antichriſt, nor doth ſo enthrall the People of God unto Antichriſt, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from Chriſt, no not as he is Head of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer which (upon occaſio of this Point) the Examiner giveth to the Papiſts Queſtion, <hi>(Where was your Church before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?)</hi> though it ſeeme to him well and good: yet it gratifieth the Papiſts, and ſtraitneth the holy Counſell of God in Scripture. <hi>The Queſtion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is thus well anſwered,</hi> to wit, <hi>That ſince the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, Truth, and the holy Citie, (according to the Prophecy,</hi> Rev. 11. &amp; 13.) <hi>have been troden under-foot, and the whole Earth hath wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after the Beaſt; yet God hath ſtirred up witneſſes to Prophecy in ſackcloth againſt the Beaſt, during his</hi> 42 <hi>moneths Reigne. Nevertheleſſe, theſe witneſſes have in their times more or leſſe ſubmitted to Antichriſt, and his Church, Worſhip, Miniſtery, &amp;c. And ſo conſequently have been ignorant of the true Church, that is, Chriſt taken for the Church in the true Profeſſion of that holy way of worſhip, which he himſelfe at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi> This Anſwer giveth away the cauſe to the Papiſts. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Where was your Church before Luther?</hi> This Anſwer giveth it for granted, that ſince the Apoſtaſie there was no particular church extant in the world. This fully ſatisfieth their deſire, and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if there were no Church of Chriſt in the world, for ſo many Centuries of yeares till <hi>Luther,</hi> then they readily conclude, That their Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was (before <hi>Luther</hi>) the onely Church in the world. For they urge it, (and I know not how we can fairely deny it) that the Church of Chriſt, even that Church to which the keys of the kingdome are committed, (which is the viſible Church) is that againſt which the <hi>Gates of Hell ſhall not be able to prevaile,</hi> and ſo not all the Power of Antichriſt. If then the viſible Church of Chriſt ſhall never ceaſe, and yet during all that time of the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, no Church was extant in the world, but the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then during all that time (which is not yet expired) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, and hath been the onely Church of Chriſt theſe many ages. Beſides, as this Anſwerer gratifieth the Papiſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the promiſe of Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18, 19,) of none effect: ſo it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:160232:134"/>ſtraitneth the Counſell of God in the very Texts of Scripture alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by himſelf. For in that Text (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) where the outward Court is given to the Gentiles, (that is, Eccleſiaſticall Courts, given to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt &amp; his Clergy) <hi>v.</hi> 2. There alſo a rod or reed is given by the Angel unto <hi>John,</hi> to meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Which evidently holdeth forth that even then there was ſomewhere extant the Temple, that is, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Chriſt, which had communion with Chriſt as Head of the Church, there called <hi>The Altar, and the Temple,</hi> was furniſhed with true worſhippers, and all meaſured according to the Patterne of Apoſtolicall Rule. What if Eccleſiaſticall Stories be deficient in telling us the times and places of their Church-Aſſemblies? Is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word of God deficient, or the Church deficient, becauſe humane Stories are deficient? Great hath been the induſtry and vigilancy of Satan and Antichriſt, to blot out (as much as in them lay) all Monuments and Records of ſuch holy Aſſemblies: but yet ſometimes their own Inquiſitors confeſſe, that the Churches of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> or men of that way, have been extant <hi>a tempore Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, evident it is, that when the Dragon perſecuted the woman, (that is, the Church) the Church fled into the Wildernes, <hi>and was there nouriſhed for a time, and times, and halfe a time,</hi> (Rev. 12.14.) which is all the time, wherein the Beaſt reigned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. And wherein the Gentiles, having obtained Rule in the Court, <hi>trod downe the holy Citie under-foote,</hi> Rev. 11.2.</p>
               <p>Moreover, evident alſo it is, that all the Angels (or Miniſters) of Gods wrath that poured out their Vialls upon the Antichriſtian State, did all of them iſſue forth out of the Temple, and out of the Temple as then opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which argueth that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Church was not onely then viſible, but openly viſible: not viſible onely to the ſecret Aſſembly of the true worſhippers, but openly conſpicuous to them that had not ſeene it before. Now how all thoſe ſeven Angels ſhould come out of the Temple, and it openly viſible, and all of them poure out their Vialls upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian State by ſeven Degrees, to the utter deſolation of it: and yet no Church extant, either before <hi>Luther,</hi> or ſince <hi>Luther,</hi> till the utter extirpation of Antichriſt, paſſeth all my compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, we deny that it is neceſſary to Church-fellowſhip, (that is ſo neceſſary, that without it a Church cannot be) That the members ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereunto, ſhould all of them ſee, and expreſly bewaile all the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which they have been defiled with in their former Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Miniſtery worſhip, Government, &amp;c. If they ſee and bewaile ſo much of their former pollutions, as did enthrall them to Antichriſt, ſo, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from Chriſt: and withall be ready in preparation of heart, as they ſhall ſee more light, ſo to hate more and more every falſe way.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. The Examiner wrongeth himſelfe and me, to ſay, <hi>That I would have made it odious in him, to ſay that godly perſons cannot be ſo enthralled to Antichriſt, as to-ſeparate them from Chriſt.</hi> The odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe he ſpeaketh of is a contradiction: And it was himſelfe, not I, that forged that contradiction, as hath been ſhewed above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. My words out of which he gathereth this obſervation, are miſreported: and the contradiction ariſeth from his miſreport, not from my words. For Gods People, and godly perſons are not all one. Any Church-members may be called Gods People, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in externall Covenant with him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.) and yet they are not alwayes godly perſons. Gods People may be ſo enthralled to Antichriſt, as to ſeparate them utterly from Chriſt, both as Head of the viſible, and inviſible Church alſo. But godly perſons cannot be ſo enthralled to Antichriſt, as to ſeparate them from Chriſt, as the Head of the inviſible Church: though, as I ſaid before, they may be ſeparated from him, as the Head of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing which the Examinen would have to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my words, is, <hi>How eaſily a ſoule may wander in his generalls: for thus I write, though they ſee not all the pollutions, wherewith they have been defiled in their former Church-fellowſhip: Againe, if they did ſee ſo much as did enthrall them to Antichriſt, and ſeparate them from Chriſt. And yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he expreſſeth nothing of that, all the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor what ſo much is, as will ſeparate them from Chriſt.</hi>

Though theſe words might ſeeme generall to a ſtranger, who knew nothing of the occaſion of them: yet to the Examiner himſelfe, (to whom in private I writ them) it was eaſie and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to poynt with the finger, at the particular I intended in theſe. He knoweth the Queſtion was; <hi>Whether the hearing of the Miniſters of the Pariſhes in</hi> England, <hi>was ſuch an Antichriſtian pollution, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cut off ſuch perſons from Church-fellowſhip, or the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Chriſt.</hi> Our Anſwer was; 1. That it was no Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pollution at all: 2. If it were, it was more then either our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or our Churches yet ſaw, or were convinced of: and then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confeſſions, and generall repentance would ſerve for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:160232:136"/>knowne ſinnes. To the ſame purpoſe, is this generall Anſwer fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med here: which himſelfe well knoweth upon what particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it grew, and to what particular caſe it had reference.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Beſides, why ſhould we count the Anſwer as wandring in Generalities, when it was fitted to his generall Objection? His Objection was <hi>Chapt.</hi> 10. <hi>That a neceſſitie lay upon, godly men, before they can be fit matter for Church fellowſhip, to ſee, bewaile, repent, come out of the falſe Churches, Worſhip, Miniſtery, Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here are onely generall words: no particular mention of the falſhoods that lye in the Churches, Worſhip, Miniſtery, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Why ſhould he blame wandring in Generalitie in the Anſwer, when his own Objection wandereth in the like Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. If he pleaſe to look back to the Reply given in his 12. Chapter, he may finde me plaine and punctuall in Inſtancing in particulars. But thus having paſſed over his Obſervations upon my former Anſwer, he now cometh to returne Anſwer to me, by demanding a Queſtion or two, to wit, 1. <hi>Whether if a godly perſon remaine a member of a ſalſely conſtituted Church, and ſo conſequently (in that reſpect) of a falſe Chriſt, whether in viſible worſhip he be not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the true Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I may not delude neither him, nor my ſelfe, by anſwering to obſcure and ambiguous termes, I would know (by ſome that underſtand his ſpeech) what he meaneth <hi>by a falſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Church:</hi> or elſe give me leave to explaine the termes my ſelfe. There be but two things intrinſecally neceſſary to the conſtitution of any thing, &amp; ſo of a Church, to wit, a fit matter, and a fit forme. The matter of a Church are viſible Saints, Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſors of the faith of Chriſt. The forme, is an holy Covenant, or Agreement, (either explicite or implicite) to joyne together in one Congregation, to worſhip the Lord, and to edifie one another in the Adminiſtration of his holy Ordinances. Now if in ſtead of viſible Saints profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, there be a company of prophane perſons, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, Hereticks, that ſhall covenant, or agree together to joyne in a Congregation to worſhip Idolls, and to build up one another in Hereſie, and Apoſtaſie; This is <hi>Eccleſia Malignantium,</hi> a falſe conſtituted Church: And conſequently, the Head of this Church is a falſe Chriſt, and every member of this Church, who joyneth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:160232:136"/>with them in this way, is in viſible worſhip, ſeparate from the true Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this ſence, I would anſwer to the Examiners firſt Queſtion, Affirmatively.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Queſtion then is, <hi>Whether it be not abſolutely neceſſary to a godly perſons uniting with the true Church, (that is, with Chriſt in true Chriſtian worſhip) that he ſee and bewaile, and abſolutely come out from that former falſe Church, or Chriſt, and his Miniſtery, Worſhip, &amp;c. before he can be united to the true Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I would readily anſwer this Queſtion, Affirmatively alſo, unleſſe there be a fallacy in the latter abſolutely. For his Queſtion is, <hi>Whether it be not abſolutely neceſſary unto uniting with a true Church, to ſee, and bewaile, and come out abſolutely from the falſe Church, or Chriſt, or Miniſtery, or Worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> This latter abſolutely, if it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no more then coming out altogether from all that ſeparateth from true Chriſt, I grant it abſolutely: but if he meane coming out from every thing of theirs, ſay from every good gift, yea from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry error amongſt them, which doth not ſeparate from Chriſt, and then I deny that it is abſolutely neceſſary, either to ſee or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile all, or in that ſence abſolutely to come out of all.</p>
               <p>His ſimilitudes brought to the contrary, may perſwade a ſelfe-pleaſing fancy, but will not convince nor ſatisſie any ſolid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Might not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that came out of Aegypt, borrow Jewells of ſilver and gold from the Aegyptians, yea and carry up alſo a mixed multitude of People, and yet build a Tabernacle to the Lord in the Wilderneſſe? <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.35. to 38. Might not the <hi>Jewes</hi> come out of <hi>Babel,</hi> and accept from all the People, where they had ſojourned, veſſells of ſilver, and gold, with goods and beaſts, and other precious things, and yet build a Temple at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem? Ezra</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. May not a ſoule be married to Chriſt, and yet his former husband (his corrupt nature) not be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dead, as the husband of a wife muſt be, before ſhee can be lawfully married to another?</p>
               <p>The Graft cut off from one tree, may be engrafted to another: and yet carry forth his old leaves with him. The kingdome of Chriſt that is cut off from the Romane Monarchy, may yet for a time have ſome entercourſe with the Romane Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though united with Chriſt, and waſhed from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:160232:137"/>their former Idolatry, as well as from other ſinnes: yet ſtill were defiled with communion in Idols Temples, and with Fornication.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> turned from their former Idolls, to ſerve the living and true God: yet they had ſome amongſt them, that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inordinately after their entrance into Church-eſtate, as well as before, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. Beſides, for a further anſwer to his ſimilitudes, the Examiner may remember, that though <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> locally, before they could ſacrifice to God in the Wildernes, yet in their hearts and ſoules they were ſtill for <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Exod. 14.11, 12. Yea and for Aegyptian Idolls, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.39. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.7, 8. which is more then we doe allow to our ſelves.</p>

               <p>HIs 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter is ſpent in Examining and anſwering a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I gave of my ſecond Anſwer to his Objection, which was propounded and cleared in the former Chapter. The Reaſon was this. <hi>The Church of Chriſt received many thouſand</hi> Jewes, <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on the Name of Chriſt, although they were ſtill zealous of the Law, and ſaw not the beggarly emptineſſe of</hi> Moſes <hi>his Ceremonies,</hi> Act. 21.20. <hi>And the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>directeth the</hi> Romans <hi>to receive ſuch unto them, as were weake in the faith, and ſaw not their liberty from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile difference of Meats and Dayes, but ſtill lay under the bondage of the Law. Yea he wiſhed them to receive ſuch upon this ground, becauſe Chriſt had received them,</hi> Rom. 14.1. to 6. <hi>And leſt it ſhould be objected, there was not the like danger of lying under bondage to</hi> Moſes, <hi>as to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; It was ſaid, that even the bondage under</hi> Moſes <hi>was ſuch, as that if it were continued in, after inſtruction and conviction, it would ſeparate them from Chriſt,</hi> (Gal. 5.2.) <hi>and bondage under Antichriſt could doe no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Anſwer hereto, the Examiner would have two things to be carefully minded:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Ordinances of</hi> Moſes <hi>were ſometimes the Ordinances of God: and when they were to vaniſh, they were to be taken away with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. I never heard or read till now, that <hi>Paul</hi> ever went to Maſſe, Prayed to Saints, kept Chriſtmaſſe, or the like: nor did I ever imagine, that any ingenuous minde would thinke that ever it came into my heart to plead for ſuch things now, or for the retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Popiſh Rite at all. But the wit and lip of man being let looſe, and left to it ſelfe, may inferre <hi>quodlibet ex quolibet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, his Parentheſis (as <hi>Paul</hi>) had reference onely to a Meſſenger of Chriſt, (as <hi>Paul</hi>) not to any ſuch like act of <hi>Paul,</hi> then his Argument is no more concluſive then a <hi>Baculo ad Angulum.</hi> What colour were there that any man now ſhould plead <hi>Pauls</hi> example, to doe that now, which <hi>Paul</hi> never did, nor any thing like it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. The Examiner requireth two things here to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully minded: In anſwer whereto, I deſire but one thing to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully minded: to wit, to what end, I alledged the ignorance of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Primitive times, and the indulgence of the Chriſtian Churches, for receiving them into Church-fellowſhip, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch ignorance: And then ſee, if it doe not inferre that which I brought it for.</p>
               <p>If in the Primitive times, the ignorance of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in many waighty Points of Religion, and ſome of them fundamentall, did not hinder their receiving into Chriſtian Church-fellowſhip, nor diſanull their Church-eſtate (who ſo received them) then it is not ſo neceſſary to Church-fellowſhip, as that without it a Church cannot be, that the Members admitted thereunto, ſhould all of them ſee and expreſly bewaile, all the pollutions, wherewith they have been defiled in their former Church-fellowſhip, Miniſtery, Worſhip, Government, &amp;c. But the former is true, as hath been opened from <hi>Acts</hi> 21.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. to 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. To which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:160232:138"/>may be added, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5. with 24. Where it appeareth ſome of the members of the Church and of the Synod, held forth ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip, touching the neceſſitie of Circumciſion, and obſervation of the Law, as tended to the ſubverſion of ſoules: and yet neither their memberſhip, nor the Eſtate of the Church was thereby diſanulled.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion is evident from theſe Premiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a vaine thing now to alledge, that the Ordinances of</hi> Moſes <hi>were ſometimes the Ordinances of God, but ſo the inventions of Antichriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were: and there is not the like honourable reſpect and tenderneſſe to be ſhewed to the inventions of Antichriſt, as to the vaniſhing Ordinances of God;</hi> For though this were of weight, in caſe I had pleaded for the practiſe of any Antichriſtian inventions, (which indeed was farre off, both from my meaning and words:) yet in this caſe it is wholly impertinent. For that which I pleaded for, was, the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of godly Perſons of Church-eſtate, notwithſtanding their ignorance of ſome weighty and neceſſary truths: and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Church-eſtate, notwithſtanding their admiſſion and toleration of ſuch ignorant members: unto which the difference of the ſeverall objects of their ignorance maketh nothing at all. For the ignorance of weighty Truths (of one ſort as well as another) neceſſary to ſalvation, is a ſinne of like deſtructive nature, of what kinde ſoever the Truths be.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is no need, either for the clearing of our members, or of our Church-eſtate, to plead for the capableneſſe of godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Church-eſtate, notwithſtanding their ignorance of the Truths of God, whether more or leſſe neceſſary: For wee doe not look at it as any point of ignorance at all, for our members to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they may partake in the gifts of the godly Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in hearing the word of God from them. I know the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is vehement and peremptory in pleading for an <hi>abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, that godly perſons before they doe joyne to a true Church, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, ſhould ſee and bewaile ſo much as may amount to cut off the ſoule from a falſe Church, (whether Nationall, Pariſhionall, or any other falſly conſtituted Church) Miniſtery, Worſhip, and Government of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the voyce of God is not alwayes in every vehement and mightie winde, that rendeth mountaines, and breaketh rockes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.11. The Examiner is not ignorant, that we have ſeene,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:160232:138"/>and bewailed Nationall, and Pariſhionall Church-eſtate, and have cut off our ſelves (by the Grace of Chriſt) from any invented wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or government of it: yea and from ſuch entrance into the Miniſtery or Adminiſtration of it, as was corrupt either by Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or Pariſhionall Relation. But this is that which he requireth further, (He I ſay, but not the Lord) that wee ſhould cut off our ſelves from hearing the Miniſtery of the Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſtery of a Nationall, or Pariſhionall Church, whereof both the Church-eſtate is falſly conſtituted, and all the Miniſtery, Worſhip, and Government thereof falſe alſo.</p>
               <p>But two things here may ſuffice to anſwer this clamour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe all this were true, that he clamoureth, but prooveth not: yet this would I faine learne, wherein lieth the ſinne of our members in hearing the godly Miniſters in the Pariſhes? <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that they doe not cut off themſelves from a falſe Miniſtery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by the Miniſtery may be meant, either the office of the Miniſtery, or the exerciſe of the office, and gifts of the Miniſtery. From the office, and from the exerciſe of the office, our members have cut off themſelves, partly by ſubmitting themſelves to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of their own Election in theſe Churches, and partly by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to no act of their Miniſteriall office in <hi>England,</hi> but what an Indian, or any Pagan might partake in, who yet is cut off farre enough from fellowſhip in their office.</p>
               <p>Cutting off, is an act of diſunion, and ſomewhat more violent, and keene, then (it may be) the Examiner requireth. The ſinne he chargeth upon our members in hearing ſuch Miniſters, is union, or communion with them. And what ſhall wee ſay, is there no Communion between our members, and the Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> whom they doe heare?</p>
               <p>Yes doubtleſſe: For 1. There is a naturall communion between the ſpeaker and the hearer: the one giveth counſell, or inſtruction, or reproofe, or comfort; and the other receiveth it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a morall Communion between a Teacher and a learner: and doubtleſſe, our hearers may learne many precious Truths from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſhall I ſay further; Is there not alſo a ſpirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between the Preacher and the Hearer, when the Preacher communicateth many ſpirituall and heavenly Points, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer receiveth them?</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:160232:139"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some would ſay; It is not neceſſary, that this ſhould breed a ſpirituall Communion between the Preacher and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: No more then it maketh a Mathematicall Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a reader of the Mathematicks, and the learner of ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Concluſions from him.</p>
               <p>But 2. I would rather anſwer otherwiſe. For ſuppoſe a member of our Churches, though a viſible Saint here, yet indeed an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, ſhould occaſionally heare a Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi> and by the Power of the Spirit of Grace breathing in his Miniſtery, be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally brought home to Chriſt, and by lively faith united to him: Here is a ſpirituall Relation and Communion wrought between them: the one is a ſpirituall Father; the other a naturall Sonne in the Faith.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, this I would ſay, that this ſpirituall Communion is not between this Hearer and this Miniſter, in reſpect of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but in reſpect of his Gifts, and of the Power of the Spirit of Grace breathing in the diſpenſation of his Gifts. In which reſpect this Communion doth not amount to Church-communion: Any ſtranger might enjoy as much. Any Pagan <hi>Corinthian</hi> might come in, and heare in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.24, 25. and reape a bleſſing thereby, who yet had not Eccleſiaſticall Communion with their Office. Alſo the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> heard the falſe Prophet <hi>Hanani,</hi> yea (and in ſome ſence) ſaid Amen to his Prophecy: yet had he no communion with his falſe Office, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.1. to 6. If he ſtill urge, that we have not yet cut off our ſelves from communion, no not with the falſe office of the Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi> and with their falſe Church-eſtate, in as much as we ſtill retaine their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, wherein we ſubjected our ſelves to their Office, and to their Church-eſtate, (which are both falſe:) as well as their Worſhip, and their Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a further Objection, then he held forth whileſt he continued with us: and therefore no marvell, if my Letter ſpake nothing to it. But therefore let me now propound another Point, which may ſuffice both for an Anſwer to this Objection, as alſo for a ſecond Anſwer unto the former clamour, and exception againſt hearing of the godly Miniſters in <hi>England.</hi> The Point is this; That I doe not ſee, how the Examiner can juſtifie his grievous charge, that their Church is falſly conſtituted, (whether Nationall or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhionall)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:160232:139"/>and accordingly, that their Miniſtery, Worſhip, and Government are all of them falſe. Foure things he chargeth to be falſe. 1. Their Church conſtitution, Pariſhionall and Nationall. 2. Their Miniſters. 3. Their Worſhip. 4. Their Government.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, touching the conſtitution of their Pariſhionall Churches, let it be conſidered what I ſaid before, that where there be viſible Saints, there is the true matter of the Church; and where there is a Covenant or Agreement (whether explicite or implicite) to aſſemble together in one Congregation, to worſhip the Lord, and to edifie one another in the Ordinances of Chriſt, there is (for ſubſtance) the true forme of a Church. And where there is the true matter, and true forme of a Church, it cannot be truely ſaid, that ſuch a Church is falſly conſtituted. For there being but two cauſes of which a thing is conſtituted, matter and forme: whatſoever hath true matter, and true forme, is truly conſtituted.</p>
               <p>Againſt this, what he will accept I doe not know: and therefore know not how to prevent him with a fit and juſt defence. But by others, two things are wont to be objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. From the matter of the Church. <hi>Object.</hi> 2. From the efficient cauſe of the Church.</p>
               <p>From the matter of the Church, it is objected, that there be not onely viſible Saints in the Engliſh Pariſhes, but with them are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled many ignorant, and ſcandalous perſons, drunkards, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, deſpiſers and perſecutors of them that are good, Prophane ſwearers, that have not ſo much as a forme of godlineſſe, but doe utterly deny and deride the power of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is indeed juſt matter of mourning and lamentation to all the Saints of Chriſt, and may be alſo (in due order) juſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſome degree of ſeparation from them, as from a corrupt Church. It cannot but offend and deeply grieve the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, to ſit downe at the Lords Table, and drinke the bloud of the Lord with ſuch, who may be ready the next day to ſpill the bloud of ſincere Communicants as Puritan Round-Heads.</p>
               <p>But whileſt the Saints of Chriſt continue amongſt them, the mixt fellowſhip of ignorant and prophane perſons doth not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate or diſanull their Church eſtate. The ſtore of malignant and noyſome humours in the body, yea the deadneſſe and rottenneſſe of many members in the body, though they may make the body
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:160232:140"/>an unſound and corrupt body, yet they doe not make the body no body. When the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complained, that in the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> from the ſoale of the foote to the crowne of the head, there was no ſoundneſſe in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſores; yet whileſt there was a Remnant amongſt them of faithfull Saints, they were not yet no Church, they were not yet <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> though but for that Remnant, they had been as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and like unto <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> Iſa. 1.6. with 9. Say not though <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were at that time degenerate, yet they had been at firſt an holy Nation, a faithfull Citie, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.21.) and ſo had a true conſtitution: which the Churches of <hi>England</hi> never had.</p>
               <p>For 1. I might anſwer, That though in regard of ſome prime members, <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was counted a faithfull Citie, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Holy, by Priviledge of their Covenant: yet for the body of the people, <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was alwayes a City of the provocation of Gods wrath from the day they built it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.31, 32. And for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nation, <hi>Moſes</hi> charged them; <hi>Yee have alwayes been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious againſt the Lord, ſince the day that I knew you,</hi> Deut. 9.7.24. And <hi>Stephen</hi> proteſteth againſt them; <hi>They had alwayes wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, they and their fathers,</hi> Act. 7.51.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I doe not underſtand, but that (according to Scripture) thoſe corruptions which doe not deſtroy a Church conſtituted, the ſame do not deſtroy the conſtitution of a Church. The Church is conſtituted, and continued by the ſame Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The eſtate of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> was not corrupt in their firſt conſtitution. <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, that <hi>England</hi> received the Goſpel ten yeares before <hi>Rome;</hi> and that from the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolick men: who doubtleſſe conſtituted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches:) not after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which was then Pagan;) but after the Apoſtolick Rules and Patternes.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice touching the matter of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches. Now touching the ſecond thing objected, which was from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of their conſtitution; It is ſaid, they were gathered not by the preaching of the Goſpel, (by which Churches ſhould be planted and conſtituted) but by the Proclamation of Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The efficient cauſe of a Church is a thing without the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:160232:140"/>Church, and ſo no eſſentiall cauſe of the Conſtitution of a Church. The Proclamation of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and of the Princes, drew on multitudes of Apoſtate <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the Communion of the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and many of them in much pollution: yet neither their own pollution, nor the Proclamation of the King and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did evacuate their Church-eſtate, but encourage them rather in their Church-worke, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.5. to 9. and verſes 11, 12.17, 18, 19, 20. It was no pollution to the ſecond Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that it was built by the encouragement of the Proclamation of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> Ezra 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Whereſoever there be viſible Saints gathered into a Church, they were firſt gathered by the Miniſtery of the Goſpel. For Proclamations cannot make Saints, but the word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel onely. If any hypocrites, or time-ſervers, doe for feare joyne themſelves with the Saints in ſuch a worke; though their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may weaken and blemiſh the worke, yet it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</p>
               <p>Thus much touching the conſtitution of their Pariſhionall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Now touching their Nationall Conſtitution, it ſtandeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Nationall Officers, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors; partly, in their Nationall Synods and convocations; and partly alſo in their Nationall Eccleſiaſticall Courts.</p>
               <p>The Examiner is not ignorant, that (by the Grace of Chriſt) we have withdrawen our ſelves, and our Churches alſo from this Nationall Conſtitution, and from all Communion with them.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid; But we ſtill keepe Communion with the Pariſh-Churches, (in hearing the Word there) who doe ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to theſe Nationall Officers, Convocations, and Courts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though the Pariſh-Churches were lately ſubject to them, it was a burden (which as they did diſcerne the iniquitie thereof) they groaned under, and now by the mightie Power of the gracious Redemption of the Lord Jeſus, they have ſhaken off through the helpe of the Honorable, and Religious Prudence and Piety of the Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though thoſe Nationall Courts in their Officers, did for many yeares tread downe the Pariſh-Churches, yet they did not extinguiſh their Church-eſtate. The Text is plaine, <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (that is, men of Gentile-like prophaneneſſe, and malignitie, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:160232:141"/>iniquitie, who had the keeping of the Church-Courts) <hi>they did tread downe the Holy City,</hi> Rev. 11.2. Tread downe (I ſay) but not deſtroy the Holy City. Yea though the Tranſlation reade it, <hi>They did tread it downe,</hi> or, <hi>Tread it under-foote:</hi> yet the Originall word may be rendred ſomewhat more mildly: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, may expreſſe their walking upon it, or elſe the Peripateticks were a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſect then either their Principles, or their Practiſe did declare them.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeake of the ſecond Falſhood, which the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner chargeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches, which was the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Miniſtery: which wherein it lyeth, he ſhould have done well to have told us: <hi>for himſelfe diſliketh it in me, to wander in Generalities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for our ſelves, we are farre from that ſupercilious, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall arrogancy, as to condemne ſuch for falſe Miniſters, in whom we finde Truth of Godlineſſe, Truth of Miniſteriall Gifts, Truth of Election and acceptance unto Office by true Churches of Chriſt, Truth of ſound, &amp; wholeſome, and ſoule-ſaving Doctrine, and Truth of holy and exemplary Converſation. And ſuch are all the Miniſters whom either the members of our Churches affect to Heare, or our Churches doe allow them ordinarily for to Heare. And when I ſay Truth, I ſpeake it not in oppoſition to Eminency, (for ſundry of them excell in Eminency of ſundry of theſe things:) but in oppoſition to the falſhood which the Examiner objecteth.</p>
               <p>I know not what exception lyeth againſt their Miniſtery, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it of falſhood, (ſave what hath been excepted and anſwered already touching the conſtitution of their Pariſhionall Churches) but onely the falſeneſſe of the Power from whence their Miniſtery is derived, to wit, from Epiſcopall Ordination.</p>
               <p>But the Examiner is much miſtaken, if he take us to conceive, or if he himſelfe conceive, that the Power of the Miniſteriall calling is derived from Ordination, whether Epiſcopall or Presbyteriall, or Congregationall. The Power of the Miniſteriall Calling is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived chiefly from Chriſt, furniſhing his ſervants with Gifts fit for the Calling; and nextly, from the Church, (or Congregation) who obſerving ſuch whom the Lord hath gifted, doe elect and call them forth to come and helpe them. For from that ground, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> (to uſe the words of the Text) aſſuredly gathered that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:160232:141"/>the Lord had called them to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Acts 16.9, 10. to wit, becauſe a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> (in the name of the reſt) had called unto them to come into <hi>Macedonia</hi> and helpe them. Paſtor and flock are Relatives: and Relatives doe conſiſt <hi>ex mutuâ alterius affectione,</hi> Their mutuall acceptance of one another is the eſſentiall cauſe of their Relation. Ordination is but <hi>adjunctum conſummans</hi> (as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ames</hi> rightly obſerveth) of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Calling: the Relation between him and the people was truly wrought before. As the Coronation of the Prince is not that which giveth the Eſſency of his Princely Calling, but Election by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (where the Government is Elective:) ſo neither is Ordination that which giveth Eſſence to the Miniſters Calling, but the peoples choice. Ordination by Impoſition of Epiſcopall hands, doth pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute an Adjunct of the Miniſters calling, (to wit, the ſolemnitie of it:) but doth not deſtroy the eſſence, or nature of it, much leſſe derive a falſe power to it, to evacuate the true.</p>
               <p>The third Falſhood, which the Examiner chargeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Pariſh-Churches, is the Falſe worſhip. And truly whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been corrupt in their worſhip, whether Preſcript, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, or undue Honour put upon Saints or Angels, in denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dayes or Temples after them, and ſuch times and places dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God, which he never required, and what ever other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of like nature, I had rather bewaile before the Lord, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or juſtifie before men. And I ſhould thinke it had been a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice to God, and his Churches, and a greater comfort to the ſoule of the Examiner, to have expreſſed particularly what the falſe worſhip had been which he beareth witneſſe againſt, and to have cleared wherein their falſhood lyeth, rather then to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in condemning all falſe worſhips in overly Generalities: and eſpecially at ſuch a time when (through mercy) the State is ſet upon Reformation, and calleth for light. He that ſhall cry out againſt all falſe wayes in Travels by Land, and exclaime againſt all Rocks and Quick-ſands by Sea, and give no particular notice where they lye, what helpe doth he afford to the carefull Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Marriner, either by Land or Sea? When Trumpets give ſuch an uncertain and obſcure ſound, who ſhall prepare themſelves to avoyd the danger on the one hand, or on the other?</p>
               <p>But for the preſent, two things would I ſay, touching the point in hand.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:160232:142"/>
               <p n="1">1. It is not every corruption in worſhip, that denominateth the worſhip to be falſe worſhip. It was doubtleſſe a corrupt worſhip to Sacrifice in the High Places: yet God doth not call it a falſe worſhip, but rather ſeemeth to accept it, as done to himſelfe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 33.17. Falſe worſhip (to ſpeake properly) is as good as no worſhip: nor is the God of Truth wont to accept that which is falſe. But there may be many aberrations in the manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when yet both the object of the worſhip is the true God, and the ſubſtance of the worſhip is true worſhip: and God may accept that which is Truth, from an honeſt and true heart, and paſſe by many aberrations, (as infirmities) and not reject all as falſities.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I would ſay, is, That whatſoever we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be corrupt, or irregular in the worſhip of God, we have beleeved it to be our duty, both to judge our ſelves for it before the Lord, and to reforme it in our practiſe. If any ſhall diſcover any further failings in our worſhip, or in the worſhip of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whom wee communicate with, I hope the Lord will not ſhut our eyes againſt the light.</p>
               <p>The fourth Falſhood, which the Examiner chargeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Churches, is falſe Government, which if he meane the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Pariſhes, by the godly Miniſters, (with whom our people communicate in hearing;) that Government is chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the publick Preaching of the Goſpel, and by private admonition. Which he that ſhall challenge it to be a falſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (though it may be defective in ſome Directions;) verily the ſpirit of Truth and Grace in thoſe who are governed and led by it, from darkneſſe to light, from the Power of Satan unto God, from a ſtate of Grace to aſſured hopes of eternall Glory in Chriſt Jeſus, will convince all ſuch ſlanderous tongues of notorious falſhood.</p>
               <p>But if he ſpeake of the Nationall-Church-Government, we muſt confeſſe the Truth, there indeed Truth is fallen, and falſhood hath prevailed much. For whether we ſpeake of the Hands, by which that Government hath been adminiſtred, or of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, in which it is adminiſtred, or of the Rule, according to which it is adminiſtred, or of the End for which it is adminiſtred; All of them are forſaken of Truth, and can challenge no warrant of Truth but falſly.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:160232:142"/>
               <p>The Hands by which that Government hath been adminiſtred, are the Prelacy, and their Servitors: who though they have of late challenged Inſtitution by Divine Right: yet the claime is utterly falſe. The Divine Authoritie hath none to attend upon Rule and Government in the Church, but ſuch as are inferior to Paſtors and Teachers in Congregations, who labour in Word and Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Dioceſan Biſhops in the dayes of the Goſpel, are like Kings in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of the Judges, both of them wanting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. What a pity is it, that ſome men eminent for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Preaching, and others for learning and moderation, ſhould come to be (as <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable ſpeaketh) advanced over their Brethren, and ſo leave their fatneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherewith they had been wont to ſerve both God and man?</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticall Courts in which that Government is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, are like the Courts of the High Prieſts, and Phariſees, which <hi>Solomon</hi> (by a ſpirit of Prophecy) ſtyleth, <hi>Dens of Lyons, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Leopards,</hi> (Cant. 4.8.) And thoſe who have had to doe with them, have found them Markets of the ſinnes of the People, the Cages of uncleanneſſe, the forgers of Extortion, the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Bribery.</p>
               <p>The Rule according to which the Government is adminiſtred, is not the word of God, (which alone is able to make a Church-Governour perfect to every good worke, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.) but in ſtead thereof the Canon Law, the Decretalls of Antichriſt, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily and falſly applyed to the Government of the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The End alſo for which this Government now for many yeares hath been adminiſtred, hath not onely been contrary to the ends of Church-Government, (which is to order the people in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and love) but even contrary to the end of Civill Government, which is the puniſhment of evill doers, and the praiſe of them that doe well, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. But here the very edge of Government, hath been bent and ſharpened chiefly againſt holineſſe and puritie. No malefactors ſo hainous, (drunkards, whoremongers, prophane perſons) but might expect the approach of Courts with leſſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and paſſe from under their hands, with more favourable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then the ſheepe of Chriſt, and the faithfull Shepheards of them.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:160232:143"/>
               <p>This Government therefore being adminiſtred with falſe Hands, on falſe Thrones, by falſe Rules, for falle Ends, I blame not the Examiner, though he ſtyle it, (as juſtly he may) a falſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But to conclude therefore this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, the Examiner tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, <hi>He beleeveth it is abſolutely neceſſary to ſee and bewaile ſo much as may amount to cut off the ſoule from a falſe Church, (whether Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or Pariſhionall, or any other falſly conſtituted Church) together with the Miniſtery, Worſhip, and Government of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that which hath been ſpoken, wee have given account, how farre we have ſeene any of theſe things to be falſe in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which his charge hath reſpect unto. And ſo farre as we have ſeene, the Lord knoweth how farre we have bewailed, and cut off our ſelves from the Fellowſhip thereof. Yea not onely from the fellowſhip of that which we diſcerne to be falſe, but alſo from what we have diſcerned to be unſound and corrupt. If we doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all thoſe things to be falſe, which he accounteth to be falſe; we have given the grounds thereof from the Scriptures of Truth. If we doe not follow him in all his imaginations, it is no marvell: The ſheepe of Chriſt know the voyce of their Shepheard: a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they will not follow. His charges of Falſhood upon Churches have been vehement, and peremptory, and in a manner ſorbonicall, without any touch of Scripture-grounds, as if he had learned not onely from them, but from the Conclave of Antichriſt, to obtrude upon the Churches of Chriſt, his unwritten imaginations and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Decrees, as the very Oracles of God.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now therefore to his next Chapter, wherein there is ſome mention of ſome Texts of Scripture, and let us ſee, whether they will ſpeake more to his purpoſe in that which remaineth.</p>

There be, and will be, when <hi>Rome</hi> is deſtroyed, and before it be deſtroyed, viſible Churches of Chriſt, (as was <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> of old;) into which theſe Saints who are called to depart out of <hi>Rome,</hi> have a juſt calling to come and to joyne themſelves. For it is out of the Temple, and out of the Temple open in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, out of which thoſe Angels come, who powre out the vialls of Gods wrath, both upon the Antichriſtian State, and upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19.</p>
               <p>The Examiner need not here aske, <hi>Whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his own ſoule, or the ſoules of other men, in making a locall depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from old</hi> England <hi>to New, as if therein we had obeyed that voyce of the Angel, Come out of Babylon my People, partake not of her ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. I doe not count <hi>England,</hi> literally to be <hi>Babel,</hi> nor myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally neither. I beleeve a man may live and dye in <hi>England,</hi> and yet obey that Commandement of the Angel in all the parts of it. Some other godly men might finde more favour and exemption from Babyloniſh corruptions in the midſt of <hi>England,</hi> then I was ſuffered to doe, without locall departure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though I thinke, that in thoſe words, <hi>Come out of Babel my People,</hi> locall ſeparation be intended, yet when he addeth, <hi>Leſt yee be partakers</hi>

                  <hi>her ſinnes,</hi> I beleeve, ſpirituall ſeparation is much more required: and locall ſeparation as a meanes the better to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that end of ſpirituall ſeparation from partaking in her ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Which may alſo cleare the meaning of the Text, and the fraud of the Examiner. For the words are not (as he alledgeth them) <hi>Come out of Babel, my people, Partake not of her ſinnes:</hi> For ſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part might be an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or explanation of the former: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Babel,</hi> might be all one with, <hi>Partake not of her ſinnes.</hi> But the words of the Text be, <hi>Come out of her, my People, that yee be not partaker of her ſinnes.</hi> Which plainly argueth, that coming out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:160232:144"/>of <hi>Babel</hi> locally, is a meanes to prevent partaking in her ſinnes ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>It is true which he ſaith, <hi>The Lord Jeſus hath broken downe all difference of Places,</hi> (Joh. 4.) <hi>and all difference of Perſons,</hi> Acts 10. To wit, in regard of ceremoniall pollution, or ceremoniall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But if he thinke, there is no difference between one Citie, or Countrey more then another in morall pollutions of Idolatry, &amp; ſuperſtition, unrighteouſneſſe and uncleanneſſe, he maketh himſelfe a greater ſtranger both to the Word and to the world, then I did thinke he had been.</p>
               <p>The two cauſes of Gods Indignation againſt <hi>England,</hi> which he ſuggeſteth, are worthy due conſideration and attention. I would rather ſay Amen to them, then weaken the weight of them. Onely I ſhould ſo aſſent to the latter, as not to moove for a Toleration of all Diſſenters, Diſſenters in Fundamentalls, and that out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy againſt conſcience, and Seducers, to the perdition of ſoules, and to the diſturbance of Civill and Church-Peace: but onely of ſuch Diſſenters, as vary either in matters of leſſe weight, or of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, yet not out of wilfull obſtinacy, but out of tenderneſſe of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>As for the Controverſie, which the Examiner ſaith, <hi>He hath with me, Whether falſe worſhip be not onely locall, but a ſpirituall Guilt, and not onely a Guilt, but alſo an Habit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe acknowledge no ſuch controverſie between us: I wholly conſent with him in the Point. Onely I doe not beleeve, all that to be either a Guilt, or an Habit of falſe worſhip, which he doth imagine: but in his termes I accord.</p>

               <p>HIs 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter is taken up in Examining and Anſwering the Expoſition which my Letter gave of that Text formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. Of which I ſaid,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Text onely requireth Coming out from Idolaters in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Idolatry: No Marriages were they to make with them: No Feaſts were they to hold with them in the Idolls Temples: No intimate Familiaritie were they to maintaine with them: Nor any Fellowſhip
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:160232:145"/>were they to keepe with them in the unfruitfull workes of Darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is all which the place requireth. But what maketh all this to proove, that we may not receive ſuch Perſons to Church-fellowſhip as our ſelves confeſſe to be godly, and who doe profeſſedly bewaile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all knowne ſinne, and would renounce more, if they knew more? Although, it may be, they doe not ſee the utmoſt skirts of all that polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have ſometimes been defiled with: as the Patriarchs ſaw not the pollution of their Polygamy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anſwer to this, the Examiner telleth us;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That if the regenerate and prepenting Engliſh did come thus farre forth, it would availe much to the ſanctifying of the Name of the Lord Jeſus, to the pacifying of his jealouſie, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But this is no Anſwer at all, unleſſe he did aſſume that our repenting <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not come thus farre forth.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> That former Diſtinction hath been conſidered above and weighed; but hath been found impertinent to the caſe in hand. The Examiner neither doth, nor ever will make it good, That the Godly perſons amongſt us doe live in any ungodly practiſes of falſe worſhip. Nor doe they take his Affirmation (without any mention of Scripture-ground) for a ſufficient conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if there be any voyce of Chriſt in the mouths of his witneſſes againſt theſe ſinnes, they are not then of ignorance, but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſpirituall hardneſſe againſt the wayes of Gods ſeare,</hi> Iſai. 63. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, what if there be ſome witneſſes have teſtified againſt the falſe worſhip in <hi>England,</hi> and againſt the hearing of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by reaſon of that falſe worſhip? What if the Godly Perſons (of whom he ſpeaketh) here, are not ſo ignorant, but they know what thoſe witneſſes have ſaid, nor ſo negligent, but they have du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered and pondered the ſame, and weighing it in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Scriptures, have found it too light? Is it ſpirituall hardneſſe, to chooſe, rather to feare God, and his Word, then to feare the falſe Interpretations and Applications of it by the ſpirit of Error? The word of the Lord wee reverence and acknowledge, <hi>Come not yee to Gilgall, neither goe yee up to Bethaven:</hi> But doe wee come to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> or goe up to <hi>Bethaven,</hi> when we heare the word of the Lord from the godly Preachers in the Pariſhes in <hi>England?</hi> If ſuch alledgements of Scripture may goe for the voyce of Chriſt in the mouths of his witneſſes, we ſhall ſoone forget the Counſell of <hi>Solomon; Ceaſe my Sonne to heare the Inſtruction, which cauſeth to erre from the words of knowledge,</hi> Pro. 19.27. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath long ſince directed us, <hi>Hereby know we the ſpirit of Truth, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error: He that knoweth God, heareth us,</hi> (that is, the Apoſtles, and thoſe that preach their Doctrine;) <hi>He that is not of God, heareth us not,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.6.</p>
               <p>But for another Anſwer, the Examiner proceedeth; <hi>Moreover,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Queſtion is not of the utmoſt skirts of pollution, but the ſubſtance of a true and falſe Bed of worſhip,</hi> Cant. 1.16. <hi>In reſpect of coming out of the falſe, before the entrance into the true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I ſaid indeed, that <hi>Godly Perſons repenting of all knowne ſinnes, may be received to Church-fellowſhip, although they doe not ſee the utmoſt skirts of all the pollution they have ſometimes been defiled with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Queſtion is not of utmoſt skirts, but of the ſubſtance of a true and falſe Bed of worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he meaneth by the <hi>Bed of worſhip,</hi> I know not If he meane the Church, to be the Bed of worſhip; and the Churches of <hi>England</hi> to be falſe Churches, that Point hath been cleared above: that no voyce of Chriſt hath declared the Churches of <hi>England</hi> to be falſe Churches.</p>
               <p>But yet further, the Examiner anſwereth, <hi>That if there were but filthineſſe in the skirts of an Harlot, he beleeveth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:160232:146"/>not receive an Harlot, infamous for corporall whoredome, without ſound repentance, not onely for her actuall whoredomes, but alſo for her whoriſh ſpeeches, geſtures, appearances, provocations. And why ſhould there be a greater ſtrictneſſe for the skirts of common whoredome, then for ſpirituall and ſoule-whoredome, againſt the chaſtitie of Gods worſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. There may be the greater ſtrictneſſe about the skirts of bodily whoredome, not becauſe it is a greater ſinne, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more eaſily diſcernable, and convinceable by ordinary light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where any ſpeeches, geſtures, appearances, provocations of ſpirituall whoredome ſhall diſcover themſelves, we beleeve there ought to be as great ſtrictneſſe about them, as about the like who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh appearances of bodily whoredome. But when will the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſcover to us, what thoſe ſpirituall whoriſh geſtures or ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be, wherein we ſhew leſſe ſtrictneſſe, then the chaſtitie of Gods holy worſhip requireth?</p>
               <p>Touching the Polygamy of the Fathers, the Examiner anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By obſerving what great ſinnes Godly Perſons may be ſubject to, notwithſtanding Godlineſſe in the Roote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee conſent to that, eſpecially in caſe of ignorance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He demandeth, <hi>If any godly Perſons ſhould now beleeve, and maintaine, that he ought to have many wives, and accordingly did ſo Practiſe, whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>would receive ſuch a godly Perſon to Church-fellowſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea whether the Church of the</hi> Jewes <hi>(if they had ſeene the evill of it) would ever have received ſuch a Proſelyte into fellowſhip with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Anſwers may ſerve to both the Demands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neither would I receive them, nor doe I thinke the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> would, in caſe the ſinne had appeared ſo plaine and palpable, as by the light of the Goſpel it hath been diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is not the caſe in hand, what my ſelfe or a Church ought to doe, about receiving a member living in knowne ſinne: but when he that liveth in no knowne ſinne, (none knowne either to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or the Church) whether the Church if they receive him, doth thereby evacuate their Church-eſtate? Or whether the Church, and every member thereof, be ſo farre bound to a diſtinct knowledge of all appearances of ſpirituall whoredome, that if they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:160232:146"/>be ignorant of any one or two of them, they are utterly uncapable of Church-eſtate?</p>
               <p>For a third Anſwer to the caſe of Polygamy, the Examiner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>what was this perſonall ſinne of Polygamy in the godly Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs? Was it any matter of Gods worſhip, any joyning with a falſe Church, Miniſtery, Worſhip, Government, from whence they were to come, before they could conſtitute his true Church, and enjoy his Worſhip, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Government, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Polygamy if it had been knowne to be as great a ſinne amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as it is now knowne to be by the Doctrine of the Lord Jeſus, it is of ſo hainous a nature now, that every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon guilty of it, muſt come out of it, before he could lawfully be received into a pure Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a Church were now ignorant of ſuch a knowne caſe, and ſhould in their ignorance admit ſundry members living in that ſinne, into fellowſhip with them, though it would much defile them: yet I doe not conceive it would evacuate their Church-eſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Examiner will never proove, that the eſtate of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>England</hi> is falſe, their Miniſtery falſe, nor their worſhip falſe. And as for their Epiſcopall Government, he is not ignorant we have come out of it both in place and heart. Neither will he ever be able to prove, that any of our Churches partake in the communion of any ſuch knowne ſinne, either in Church-eſtate, Worſhip, Miniſtery, Government, as Polygamy is.</p>
               <p>But touching that place in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. urged by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer, that I might give a further Anſwer then before, I adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Letter; <hi>That the place was wreſted beſides the Apoſtles ſcope, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Williams <hi>argued from it, That ſuch Perſons are not fit matter for Church-fellowſhip, as are defiled with any remnants of Antichriſtian Pollution: nor ſuch Churches any more to be counted Churches, as doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch amongst them: For were there not at that time in the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>ſuch as partaked with Idolaters in their Idolls Temples? And was not this the touching of an uncleane thing? And did this ſinne reject members from Church-fellowſhip before Conviction? Or did it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate their Church-eſtate for not caſting out ſuch members?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Argument the Examiner giveth (as he calleth it) an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in foure Paragraphs: whereof the three former hold not forth ſo much as the face, or ſhape, or colour of an Anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:160232:147"/>
               <p>For in the firſt Paragraph, ſaith he, <hi>This was indeed an uncleane thing, from which God calleth his People: and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>confeſſeth, that after conviction any member obſtinate in theſe uncleane Touches ought to be rejected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this to the Argument?</p>
               <p>Againe, In the next Paragraph, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the ſame ground,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that one obſtinate Perſon ought to be rejected out of Church-eſtate, upon the ſame ground, if a greater company or a Church were obſtinate in ſuch uncleane touches, ought every ſound Chriſtian Church to reject them, and every ſound member to withdraw from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is this any more to the Argument?</p>
               <p>In the third Paragraph, <hi>Further</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is cleare, that if ſuch uncleane Touches obſtinately maintained, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>profeſſeth and practiſeth) be a ground of a rejection of a Perſon in a Church, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe, it is a ground of rejection when ſuch Perſons are to joyne unto the Church. And if obſtinacy in the whole Church after Conviction be a ground for ſuch a Churches rejection, queſtionleſſe, ſuch a Church or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons obſtinate in ſuch evills, cannot congregate, nor become a true conſtituted Church of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtill the Argument is where it was, not onely unſhaken, but untoucht. Neither is the Text in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. any whit at all cleared by theſe diſcourſes, to argue them to be no true conſtituted Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who live in ſuch uncleane touches, without conviction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſtinacy. For the Text ſpeaketh nothing of obſtinacy, nor conviction: but onely implieth, that ſuch uncleane Touches were found in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and yet that did not evacuate their Church-eſtate.</p>
               <p>His laſt Paragraph holdeth forth ſome more ſhape of an Anſwer, but as little ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The greateſt Queſtion here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would be whether the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>in their firſt Conſtitution were ſeparate or no from ſuch Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>neither doth nor can deny; A Church eſtate being a ſtate of marriage unto Chriſt Jeſus; and ſo</hi> Paul <hi>profeſſedly ſaith, He had eſpouſed them as a chaſte Virgin unto Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. To put any ſubſtance into this Anſwer, or any force pertinent to the cauſe in hand, it muſt be no great Queſtion, but cleare out of Queſtion, that theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> in their firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution were cleane, and abſolutely ſeparate from ſuch Idolls Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:160232:147"/>and that not onely locally, but in their ſoule and iudgement, minde and heart, utterly cut off from ſuch uncleane Touches, ſo that they both undoubtedly ſaw the evill thereof, and from their hearts abhorred it, and forſooke it. For all theſe Acts of coming off in a way of ſeparation from the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from us, as abſolutely neceſſary to enter into a true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate. <hi>Now if he thinke that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton (to uſe his words) <hi>neither doth nor can deny, that in their firſt conſtitution they were thus ſeparate from Idolls Temples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt profeſſe, though not to him, yet to all that love and ſeek the Truth without prejudice, that I both can and doe deny it, that in their firſt conſtitution, they were locally ſeparate from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls Temples, it is likely enough; or elſe I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would have admoniſhed them thereof in their firſt Plantation. But that in their minde and judgement, they ſaw the evill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and did in heart and ſoule bewaile it, and confeſſe it before the Apoſtle and their Brethren, and ſo enter into ſolemne Covenant, expreſly againſt it; this is altogether incredible to me: For would not the Apoſtle then (out of his faithfulneſſe) have reproved them as well for their Apoſtacy, as for their Fellowſhip in Idolatry? Would he not as well have rebuked the prevarication of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as their pollution of their communion with Pagans?</p>
               <p>What though a Church-eſtate be a ſtate of Marriage unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? May not a married Spouſe of Chriſt be ignorant of ſome part of her marriage-dutie towards him? And what though <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſe, <hi>He had eſpouſed them as a chaſte Virgin to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> May not he call them a chaſte Virgin, who had ſeene and bewailed their former worſhip of Idolls, though they neither bewailed nor ſaw the evill of feaſting with their neighbours in Idolls Temples?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Though the Examiner make it a great Queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Church can be truely conſtituted, that in her firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſeperate from all uncleane Touches, ſo as both to ſee them, and come out of them, howſoever they may fall into ſuch ſinnes afterwards: yet I looke at it as an ungrounded diſtinction, to require more purity to the being of a Church in her firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, then is neceſſary to the being of it, after it is conſtituted. I ſhould thinke the longer a Church hath enjoyed communion with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the more ſhee ought to grow both in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:160232:148"/>knowledge and purity. Where more hath been given, the more will be required of the Lord. Yea I conceive it more agreeable to the word of Truth, that God will ſooner ſeparate from a Church conſtituted, for their whoriſh pollutions, then deny them Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate for the like pollutions in their firſt conſtitution. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not conſtituted a Nationall Church till the Lord gave them Nationall Ordinances, and Nationall Officers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them together into a Nationall Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. Their Church-eſtate before, was rather domeſticall, diſperſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall Families. When they were thus conſtituted a Nationall Church, and afterwards fell into an Idolatrous crime, the Lord directed <hi>Moſes</hi> to breake the Tables of his Covenant between them, and did alſo ſeperate his Tabernacle from them, till upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he renewed communion with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.3. to 7. But yet the like Idolatry (if not worſe) being found in the ſame People, when they dwelt in Aegypt, it did not hinder the Lord from accepting them unto a Nationall Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church-eſtate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To which Objection of his, (to paſſe by all verball velitations, for I love not to take up time about words) the ſubſtance of my Anſwer was two-fold.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:160232:148"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it was not neceſſary to the Admiſſion of members, that they ſhould ſee, and bewaile the ſinfulneſſe of every ſipping of the whores Cup, (as he called it) (though the Whores cup doe more intoxicate the minde, then the drunkards Cup doth the Body:) becauſe bodily drunkenneſſe and whoredome are ſuch notorious and groſſe ſinnes, that no man having true Repentance in him, cannot but be convinced of the ſinfulneſſe of them, and of the neceſſitie of repentance of them in particular, if he doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. But the whores Cup being a myſtery of Iniquitie, the ſinfulneſſe of every ſipping of it, is nothing ſo evident and notorious, as that every repentant ſoule doth at firſt diſcerne it. And therefore as the</hi> 3000. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> Acts 2.37. to 47. <hi>were admitted into the firſt Chriſtian Church, upon the Profeſſion of their repentance of the murther of Chriſt, though they neither ſaw nor confeſſed all the ſuperſtitious leavenings wherewith the Phariſees had bewitched them: ſo here, &amp;c. Yea and the Diſciples of</hi> John <hi>(whom he inſtanceth in) though they did confeſſe their ſinnes, (the Publicans theirs, the Souldiers theirs, the People theirs:) to wit, the notorious ſinnes incident to their callings: yet it doth not appeare that they confeſſed their Phariſaicall pollutions. And the Gentiles in</hi> Act. 19.18.19. <hi>Though they confeſſed their curious Arts, and burnt their conjuring Bookes, yet it doth not appeare, that they confeſſed all their deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto the Examiner returneth a two-fold Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſpirituall whoredome and drunkenneſſe is not indeed ſo eaſily diſcerned as corporall: but yet not the leſſe ſinfull, but infinitely tranſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as much as ſpirituall ſobriety exceedeth corporall; and the bed of the moſt High God exceedeth the beds of men, who are but duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It is an exorbitant Hyperbole to make every paſſage of ſpirituall whoredome, a ſinne infinitely tranſcendent above bodily whoredome. For ſpirituall whoredome is not infinite in the act of it, but onely in reſpect of the object of it, to wit, in reſpect of the infinite God, againſt whom it is committed. And is not bodily whoredome infinite in that reſpect alſo? Can a man defile himſelfe with bodily whoredome, and not ſinne againſt the infinite God? What ſaith <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Gen. 39.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if ſpirituall whoredome (though leſſe evident) be more ſinfull then bodily? The nature of true Evangelicall Repentance ſtandeth not in ſeeing and bewailing every ſinne, no nor alwayes of the greateſt, but of thoſe which are moſt evident and notorious.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:160232:149"/>A Chriſtian man may more ſafely omit repentance of greater ſins, if unknowne, then of leſſe ſinnes knowne. I ſuppoſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were guiltie of many Idolatries, and ſuperſtitions in the dayes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> yet their repentance was chiefly faſtned upon their asking of a King, of which they were then principally convinced, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19. And ſuch Repentance was then accepted of the Lord, and of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ver. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>The very truth is, the ground and roote of the Examiners Error in this caſe is, That he maketh Church-Covenant to be no better then a Covenant of workes: whereas indeed if Church-Covenant be not a branch of the Covenant of grace, the Churches of Chriſt are not built upon Chriſt. In a Covenant of workes, all ſinnes muſt be avoyded: or if not avoyded, yet repented of expreſly, and the greateſt ſinnes moſt. But in Evangelicall Repentance, God <hi>dealeth not with us after our ſinnes, nor rewardeth us according to our Iniquities,</hi> Pſal. 103.10. The Grace of Chriſt is not given either to his Church, or to any Chriſtian, upon the perfection of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor upon our Repentance of our greateſt ſinnes, in the greateſt meaſure. But if the heart be truly humbled for any knowne ſinne, as ſinne, though the ſinne knowne be often leſſe hainous, then others unknowne, yet God accepteth his own worke, and putteth away all ſinne in the acknowledgement of one. Yea in ſinnes that be knowne, the compunction of the heart is ſometimes more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for the occaſions and inducements of the ſinne, which are leſſe hainous; then for the greater ſinnes, which are more grievous and dangerous. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his ſolemne Repentance in the Booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> doth more expreſly bewaile his entanglement with lewd women, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.27, 28. then all his Idolatrous Temples and worſhip, which were erected, and maintained at his charge. By the Examiners Doctrine, <hi>Solomon</hi> had never been received, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Church upon that Repentance.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer is, <hi>That though the converted Jewes did not ſee all the leavenings of the Phariſees, yet they mourned for killing of Chriſt, and embraced him in his Worſhip, Miniſtery, Government, &amp;c. and thereupon neceſſarily followeth a withdrawing from the Church, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and Worſhip of the falſe Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This anſwer doth not reach the defence of his cauſe, to wit, <hi>That it is abſolutely neceſſary unto Church-fellowſhip, to ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:160232:149"/>not onely actuall whoredomes, but alſo whoriſh ſpeeches, geſtures, appearances, provocations.</hi> Yet here he granteth, that <hi>the converted Jewes did not ſee all the leavenings of the Phariſees, which yet were ſuch,</hi> as in the end of that Paragraph, he <hi>implyeth they had deteined them under a falſe Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas he ſaith, that <hi>they by embracing Chriſt, in his Worſhip and Miniſtery, there neceſſarily followed a withdrawing from the Church, Miniſtery, and worſhip of the falſe Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may truely be Replyed, 1. That he will not grant us that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that upon our embracing of Chriſt in his worſhip &amp; Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there neceſſarily followeth our withdrawing from the Church, Miniſtery, and Worſhip, wherein we had been formerly polluted in any ſort. Is not this to deteine the glorious Truth of our Lord Jeſus with reſpect of Perſons?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is evident by the Story, that ſome of thoſe members of the Church of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who had been leavened by the ſect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they did neither ſee nor bewaile, nor did come off from fellowſhip with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their Miniſtery, and falſe Doctrine, which taught the neceſſitie of Circumciſion, and of the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to juſtification and ſalvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1.5.</p>
               <p>As for the confeſſion of ſinne by the Diſciples unto <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> (Mat. 3.) and by the Gentiles unto <hi>Paul,</hi> (Act. 19.) though it be not ſaid, that the one ſort confeſſed their Phariſaicall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the other all their Deeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if both theſe confeſt their notorious ſinnes,</hi> (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> confeſſeth) <hi>why not as well their notorious ſinnes againſt God, their Idolatries, ſuperſtitions, worſhips, &amp;c? Surely throughout the whole Scripture, the matters of God, and his worſhip, are firſt and moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not true, that the matters of Gods worſhip and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects there, are alwayes moſt tenderly acknowledged throughout the Confeſſions of the Saints in Scripture. <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was moſt ſparing of confeſſion of his Idolatrous Temples and worſhips. And the People in <hi>Samuel</hi> did more repent of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, then of all their other ſinnes, and yet their Idolatries were then flagrant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 9, 10, 11. Beſides, wee never reade of ſuch deepe Humiliation of <hi>David</hi> for carting the Arke after the manner of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> as of his bodily adultery with <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> and murder of <hi>

               <p>The ſubſtance of my other Anſwer to his former Objection, which was to prove <hi>a neceſſitie lying upon godly men to ſee and bewaile their pollutions in a former Church-fellowſhip, before they can be fit matter for a new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was to this purpoſe, that we have not been wanting (through the guidance of the grace of Chriſt) to performe that which he pleadeth for, ſo farre as God hath called us to it: the which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in my Letter in two particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the body of our members doe in generall Profeſſe, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their coming over to us, was that they might be freed from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of humane Inventions and Ordinances, under which as their ſoule groaned there, ſo they have profeſſed their ſorrow, ſo farre as through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or infirmitie they have been defiled there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That in our daily meetings, eſpecially in the times of our ſolemne Humiliations, we doe generally all of us bewaile all our former Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wherewith we have defiled our ſelves, and the holy things of God in our former Adminiſtrations, and Communions: the which we have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſen to doe, then to talke of, and therefore doe marvell, that he ſhould ſo reſolutely renounce us for that, which he knew not whether we had neglected or no, and before he had admoniſhed us of our ſinfulneſſe in ſuch neglect, if it had been found amongst us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto his Anſwer is; <hi>That we make no mention, what ſuch Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Ordinances, what ſuch Adminiſtrations and Communions were, which we confeſſed and bewailed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> And yet leſt he ſhould too much wound his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſuch a generall charge, he acknowledgeth; <hi>That we have borne witneſſe againſt Biſhops, and Ceremonies, and doe conſtitute onely particular and Independent Churches, and have therefore ſo farre at leaſt ſeene the evill of a Nationall Church.</hi> But I dare ſay further, that his own Conſcience beareth him witneſſe, that we have witneſſed alſo both in Profeſſion and Practiſe, againſt Preſcript Liturgies and mixt Communions, both in Church-fellowſhip, and at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>What hath been then wanting to us? <hi>That we doe not fully ſee the evill of a Nationall Church;</hi> How doth he make it to appeare?</p>
               <p>By two Inſtances.</p>

               <p>Beſides, when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> heard the word from the young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of <hi>Judah,</hi> and joyned with him in Prayer, I demand whether in ſo doing, he joyned in Church-Communion with the Nationall Church of <hi>Judah?</hi> If yea, then was the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> polluted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the uncleane Communion of Idolatrous <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> If not, then the Examiner may eaſily diſcerne, how weake an Argument it is to argue our Communion with the Nationall Church of <hi>England,</hi> from our members joyning in the Hearing of the Word, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>England.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In this I chooſe rather to blame his memory then his conſcience. But the one of them is much to blame, in that it maketh him ſo farre forget himſelfe and the Truth, as boldly to avouch a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſhood; <hi>That we Perſecuted him for his humble, and faithfull, and conſtant admoniſhing of us of ſuch uncleane walking, between a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church and a Nationall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one notable falſhood to ſay, that he did conſtantly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, either our Elders or Churches of ſuch an offence; much leſſe, humbly, and faithfully. If he did ſo admoniſh us, where are his witneſſes? His Letters? his Meſſengers ſent to us?</p>
               <p>Beſides, It is another falſhood, and no leſſe palpable, that we did perſecute him for ſuch admoniſhing of us. It hath been declared above, upon what grounds the ſentence of his Baniſhment did Proceed: whereof this Admonition (which he pretendeth) was none of them; neither did they perſecute him at all, who did ſo proceed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Now whereas in that Paſſage of the Letter even now recited I ſaid, <hi>He knew not what Profeſſions we had made in our Churches of our Humiliations for former Pollutions, nor had he admoniſhed us of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects therein: He demandeth how be could poſſibly be ignorant of our eſtate, who had been from firſt to laſt in fellowſhip with us, an Officer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:160232:151"/>amongst us, had private and publique agitations concerning our eſtate and condition, and at laſt ſuffered for ſuch Admonition to us, the miſery of a Winters Baniſhment amongst the Barbarians?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> As if every man in fellowſhip with us, an Officer amongſt us, one that had private and publique agitations with us, muſt needs know what our members profeſſed in their admiſſions to the Church, or what our Elders confeſſed in their dayes of ſolemne Humiliation, when himſelfe was generally abſent, both on the Lords dayes, and on the dayes of ſolemne faſting? Or as if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publique agitations that he had with us, were taken up about our Communion with a Nationall Church? I am yet to learne, what Arguments he did propound to us in that cauſe: what convictions he left upon us. When he is ſtill ſo full of the miſeries of his winters baniſhment amongſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me call to minde a grave and godly ſpeech of a bleſſed Saint, now with God, (reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dod) Where ſinne lyeth heavy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions lyeth light: where affliction lyeth heavy, ſinne lyeth light.</hi>

               <p>THe maine Objection which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> made againſt the Eſtate of our Church-members, was chiefly this; That though he acknowledgeth them to be godly, yet not ſufficiently ſeparate from Antichriſt. And that he endeavoured to prove, 1. From the Texts that call for ſeparation from <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſa. 52.2 Cor. 6. Rev. 18.2. From the confeſſion of ſinnes made by <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and the Proſelyte Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. To both theſe we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Anſwer already.</p>
               <p>His third Objection followeth from <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. where the Prophet telleth the Church of the <hi>Jewes, That if a Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane by a dead body, doe touch holy things, thoſe holy things become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane to him. And ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is this Nation, and ſo is every worke of their hands, and that which they offer here is uncleane.</hi> And from hence he argueth; <hi>That even Church-Covenants made and Ordinances practiſed by perſons polluted through ſpirituall deadneſſe, and filthineſſe of Communion, they become uncleane to them, and are prophaned by them: which he ſolemnely deſireth might be adviſedly weighed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:160232:151"/>
               <p>Whereto my Anſwer was; <hi>That if he had well weighed this place himſelfe, he would never have alledged it to his purpoſe. His purpoſe was to prove, that Churches cannot be conſtituted of ſuch members, as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane by Antichriſtian pollutions: or if they be ſo conſtituted, they are not to be Communicated with, but ſeparated from. To prove this, you alledge (ſaid I) this place, where the Prophet acknowledgeth the whole Church to be uncleane, and yet neither denieth them to be a Church truely conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, nor ſtirreth up himſelfe, or others to ſeparate from them. If you ſay, why, but they were uncleane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwered; <hi>Be it ſo. But were they therefore no Church truely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted? Or to be ſeparated from? Did not</hi> Haggai, <hi>and</hi> Zachary <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Communicate with them? And did they not call others alſo to come out of Babel to Communicate with them, even whileſt</hi> Joſhua <hi>the High Prieſt was ſtill polluted with his uncleane Garments?</hi> Zach. 2.6, 7. with <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I tooke occaſion to cleare up to him the occaſion, and ſcope, and true ſence of the words at large, as may appeare in the Letter, which having gathered up I ſaid, <hi>That if he did apply it to the Point in hand, it would reach nothing neere to his purpoſe. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the Church, yea and godly ſincere Chriſtians themſelves, whileſt they attend to the world more then to the things of God, (as at that time the</hi> Jewes <hi>did</hi>) <hi>both their perſons, and their labours, and their Civill Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are uncleane in the ſight of God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Church of Chriſt cannot be conſtituted of ſuch: or if it doe conſiſt of ſuch, the People of God muſt ſeparate from them. You might well have gathered</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Church of Chriſt, and the members thereof muſt ſeparate themſelves from their hypocriſie and inordinate love of this world, or elſe they and their duties will ſtill be uncleane in the ſight of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Church-Eſtate.</hi>

               <p>This Text is ſo evident, and pregnant, and full againſt himſelfe, that I could not but marvell, why he ſhould alledge it, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally why he ſhould <hi>deſire it might be throughly weighed, and the Lord to hold the ſcales himſelfe.</hi> How doe you then thinke, that he will hence inferre his Concluſion; That Godly perſons, if uncleane,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:160232:152"/>cannot conſtitute a true Church? or if they doe, they are to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from? Surely not from the words of the Text, nor from the ſence, which I make of it: nor from any ſence, which himſelfe can give of it. How then? Onely from his miſtake of my words, and that ſurely either through a drouſie Oſcitancy, or a ſleighty Precipitancy.</p>

But if I had made that Enthymeme the expreſſion of mine own meaning, and of the meaning of the Text, it had ſully and cloſely reached his own purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The next words following might alſo plainly have cleared my meaning to him: when in ſtead of that falſe collection which he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:160232:152"/>gathered, I tell him, you might well have gathered: <hi>therefore the Church of Chriſt, and the members thereof muſt ſeparate themſelves from their hypocriſie, and their inordinate love of this world: Or elſe they and their duties will he ſtill uncleane in the ſight of God, notwithſtanding their Church-eſtate.</hi>

               <p>Doe I not here plainly expreſſe two ſeverall, and contrary Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections from the Text, the one his, the other mine own; the one tending to edification, the other to deſtruction? And yet this falſe collection, and miſapplication of the Text, which is his own, and a manifeſt Perverting both of the Text, and of my words, he will needs force upon me, contrary to my meaning, and contrary alſo to my expreſſe words above in the entrance of mine Anſwer to this Text. Where I ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your purpoſe was to prove, That Churches cannot be conſtituted by ſuch perſons as are uncleane by Antichriſtian pollutions: or if they be ſo conſtituted, they are not to be communicated with, but ſeparated from. To prove this, you alledge this place where the Prophet acknowledgeth the whole Church of the</hi> Jewes <hi>to be uncleane: and yet neither denieth them to be a Church truely conſtituted, nor ſtirreth up himſelfe or others to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What by the way he diſcourſeth of the Excommunication in the Nationall Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſomewhat hath been ſpoken to it above. When he ſaith, <hi>That their Ceremoniall Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was either putting to death in</hi> Canaan, <hi>or Captivitie out of</hi> Canaan. If he meane this was all their Excommunication, I cannot aſſent to it. King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was neither put to death in <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet he was Excommunicated both from Temple-worſhip, Synagogue-worſhip, and all familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Againe, when he maketh it an Excommunication from God, in caſe God ſell his Church into ſpirituall Captivitie, to confuſed Babyloniſh Lords, and worſhip, and that ſo he driveth them out of his ſight: He might remember, that God ſometime ſold his people under the Bondage of Babyloniſh Lords, even in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (Jer. 40.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 42.10, 11, 12.) And yet he had not ſtraight way driven them out of his ſight.</p>

               <head>TO CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>IT was my ſerious and unfeigned endeavour, in my Letter which the Examiner hath anſwered, to have removed thoſe two ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks out of his way, which I perceived had turned him off, from holding fellowſhip with theſe Churches. The former was, <hi>The want of fit matter of our Churches:</hi> The latter, <hi>Our diſ-reſpect to the ſeparate Churches in</hi> England, <hi>under affliction, when nevertheleſſe our ſelves practiſe ſeparation in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the beginning of his tenth Chapter, he hath endeavoured to faſten the former of theſe ſtumbling blocks, that it may ſtill lie in his way, and ſtand (as an everlaſting wall of partition) between us. Which nevertheleſſe I have (as you ſee) through the helpe of Chriſt endeavoured to dig through the ſandineſſe thereof, that if it were the holy will of God, it might fall downe (like the walles of <hi>Jericho</hi>) before the Arke of the Lord, and neither detaine him, nor others, from Communion with us.</p>
               <p>The latter ſtumbling block, he goeth about to re-eſtabliſh in this, and the following Chapters to the end of his Booke; Come we therefore to conſider, whether there may be any hope, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this ſtumbling block alſo, and the eſtabliſhment thereof by the ſame helpe. The ſtumbling block lieth ſomewhat broader, then at firſt was propounded. The Examiner takes it as a great offence; <hi>That we walke between Chriſt and Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In practiſing ſeparation here, and not repenting of our preaching, and printing againſt it in our own Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reproaching himſelfe at</hi> Salem, <hi>and others, for ſeparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In particular, that my ſelfe have conceived and ſpoken, That ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a way, which God hath not proſpered: as if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the truth of the Churches depended upon the countenance of men, or upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace and libertie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I anſwered in my Letter, <hi>That in ſtead of hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting betwixt Chriſt, and Antichriſt, the Lord hath guided us to walke with an even foote between two extreames: ſo that we neither defile our ſelves with the remnants of pollution in other Churches; nor doe we for the remnants of pollution, renounce the Churches themſelves, nor the holy things of God amongst them, which our ſelves have found powerfull to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:160232:153"/>ſalvation. This moderation ſo farre as we have kept it in preaching or printing, we have ſeene no cauſe to repent of it; But if any ſhall ſhew us cauſe, why we ſhould repent of it, we ſhall deſire to repent of it, yea and to repent, that we repented no ſooner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Examiner here undertaketh to prove this <hi>middle walking to be no leſſe then-halting, of which we have cauſe to repent.</hi> And this he endeavours to prove to me, out of mine own Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>himſelfe confeſſeth, that no Nationall, Provinciall, Dioceſan, or Pariſh Church, wherein ſome truely godly are not, are true Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He practiſeth no Church-eſtate, but ſuch as is conſtituted onely of godly perſons, nor admitteth any unregenerate, or ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He confeſſeth, that a Church of Chriſt cannot be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſuch godly perſons, who are in bondage to the inordinate love of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That if a Church conſiſt of ſuch, Gods people ought to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If theſe (which he calleth confeſſions of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi>) have been ſtumblings to him, I ſhall (by the helpe of Chriſt) ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them out of his way. For I doe profeſſe, that I never made any ſuch Confeſſions, but looke at them all as contrary to my judgement, both in former times and to this day.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Though there were no truely godly perſons in a Church, yet if there be ſuch as profeſſe godlineſſe (ſuch as they call viſible Saints) to meete together in a Congregation to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord, and to edifie one another in the adminiſtration of his holy Ordinances, I doe beleeve there is truth of Church-eſtate.</p>
               <p>It is true, I doe beleeve, and confeſſe, that God requireth more then profeſſion of godlineſſe, even ſinceritie of holineſſe in Church-members, and it is no ſmall ſinne in them, if it be wanting; But what if ſome, if moſt, if all beleeve not? <hi>Shall their unbeliefe make the faith of God of none effect? God forbid?</hi> Rom. 3.3, 4. If an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall Church were no Church, then an hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>call Miniſter were no Miniſter, and his adminiſtrations nullities. <hi>Cultus inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> in the whole latitude of it, as Churches, Min;iſteries, Seales, Cenſures, &amp;c. they are all ordained for the Elects ſake. And the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:160232:154"/>Elect God would have them to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without carefull ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and diſtractions. If truth of Churches, and Miniſteries, and Ordinances, depended upon the perſonall ſincerity of the godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the diſpenſers, the Elect of God would ever be intangled with inextricable ſcruples, touching their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion here or there, with this or that Church, or the adminiſtrations of the Officers thereof. But God hath called us in peace.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond part (which he maketh) of my Confeſſions, he had ſaid true, if he had ſaid, I endeavour ſuch a thing, that our Church ſhould be conſtitute of godly perſons: but I doe not ſay I have attained it; for God ſeeth not as man ſeeth: man looketh at the outward appearance, but the Lord regardeth the heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. And ſure I am, we looke at Infants as members of our Church, (as being foedurally holy) but I am ſlow to beleeve that all of them are regenerate, or truly godly.</p>
               <p>As for the third and fourth point (which he maketh) of my Confeſſion; <hi>That a Church of Chriſt cannot be conſtituted of godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, taken with the inordinate love of the world: or that a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſuch, ought to be ſeparated from:</hi> Theſe are onely his own palpable miſtakes of thoſe words of mine, which I expreſſed as the ſumme of his words, which he (through haſt) conceived to be mine, whereof we have ſpoken in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>Let him not ſay (as he doth) that when I would not have <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches to be ſeparated from, for the remnants of pollutions, I mean onely, Ceremonies, and Biſhops: neither let him ſay, that I doe extenuate and mince the roote, maſſe, and ſubſtance of the matter of Nationall Churches, (though for the greater part unregenerate) by naming onely a remnant of pollutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he knoweth we wholly avoyde Nationall, Provinciall, and Dioceſan Government of the Churches by Epiſcopall Authority: He knoweth alſo, we avoyde their preſcript Liturgies, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with openly ſcandalous perſons in any Church-order; He knoweth likewiſe, (or at leaſt may know) that it is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſorrow of heart, and a mourning of our ſoules, that there is yet ſo much of thoſe notorious evills (which he nameth) ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in the Pariſhes, worldlineſſe, ignorance, ſuperſtition, ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, ſwearing, curſing, whoredome, drunkenneſſe, theft, lying, I may adde alſo murther, and malignity againſt the godly, ſuffered
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:160232:154"/>to thruſt themſelves into the fellowſhip of the Churches, and to ſit downe with the Saints at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>But yet I count all theſe but remnants of pollution, when as the ſubſtance of the true eſtate of Churches abideth (as I opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) in their Congregationall Aſſemblies. And in ſo ſpeaking, I follow the holy patterne of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a great forſaking (or Apoſtacy) in the midſt of the Land, yet reſembleth the eſtate of the Church to an Oake, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is in it, (when the leaves fall off) and maketh the holy ſeed to be that ſubſtance, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.12, 13.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond offence which the Examiner tooke at our neglect of the Churches of the ſeparation, <hi>Was the reproach of himſelfe and others at</hi> Salem, <hi>for their ſeparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwered in my Letter, <hi>That I knew no man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached</hi> Salem <hi>for their ſeparation, nor did I beleeve, that they did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate. Howſoever, if any did reproach them for it, I did thinke it a ſinne meete to be Cenſured, but not with ſo deepe a Cenſure, as to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all the Churches, or to ſeparate from them, before it doth appeare, that they doe tolerate their members in ſuch their cauſleſſe reproachings. The errors of men are to be contended againſt, not with reproaches, but with the ſword of the Spirit. But on the other ſide, the failings of the Churches are not forthwith to be healed by ſeparation. It is not Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, but Butchery, to heale every ſore in a member, with no other but Abſciſſion from the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto the Examiner anſwereth, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Salem <hi>was knowne to profeſſe ſeparation, and publickly reproached (yea he could men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Caſe wherein ſhee was puniſhed) for it, implicitely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This anſwer is ſo implicit, that I cannot make an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite anſwer to it. That which I ſaid, was, <hi>I knew no man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached</hi> Salem <hi>for their ſeparation: nor did I beleeve, that they did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate.</hi> His anſwer is, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Salem <hi>was knowne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſeparation:</hi> which croſſeth not what I ſaid; for it might be ſo, and yet I knew not of it, unleſſe the profeſſion had been more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Nor did I ever perceive, that they refuſed communion with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:160232:155"/>us, when any of them came over to us. If they were publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for ſeparation, it was more then I heard of, till I read it in his Booke. And for any publick puniſhment that <hi>Salem</hi> ſuffered for it, I may well ſay, it was implicitly, if at all; for ſurely there is no Law of the Countrey, that puniſheth ſuch an offence, it her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, or implicitly. But ſince he is pleaſed to conceale it, I ſee no cauſe of giving account of it.</p>
               <p>Nextly, He takes up from me a Confeſſion of two things, which he leaveth to me to reconcile: 1. <hi>That I ſay, if any reproach them for Seperation, it is a ſinne meete to be Cenſured.</hi> 2. <hi>That Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be ſeparated from, who tolerate their members in ſuch cauſeleſſe reproachings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is true, that I doe not account reproaches, (which are a worke of the fleſh) a meete remedy to heale an error: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reproacher meete to be delt withall, either by private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, if it were publick. But the latter of the two things which he ſaith I confeſſe, I am farre from either confeſſing it, or beleeving it; to wit, <hi>That the Churches themſelves may be ſeparated from, who tolerate their members in ſuch cauſeleſſe reproachings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid indeed, <hi>that a cauſeleſſe reproach is a ſinne meete to be cenſured: But I ſaid withall, it is not to be cenſured with ſo deepe a Cenſure, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, eſpecially of all the Churches, and that too, before that it doe appeare, that they doe tolerate their members in ſuch their cauſeleſſe reproachings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be, he will ſay, doth it not imply, that if it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that they doe tolerate their members in ſuch cauſeleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that then I thinke they are to be ſeparated from?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No verily: Put it in a like caſe: Suppoſe a childe ſhould miſcall and revile his Mothers Siſter, I might ſay, it is a fault meete to be corrected, yet not with ſo deepe a correction, as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited: or that his Mother ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed of her inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before it doe appeare, that ſhe doe tolerate her childe in ſuch revilings. Would ſuch a ſpeech inferre, that in caſe it did appeare, his Mother did tolerate him, that then his Mother were to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of her inheritance? The true meaning of my ſpeech, was to expreſſe, that ſuch a ſinne, as reproaching of a Church for a ſin, might deſerve a Cenſure: yet not forthwith excommunication:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:160232:155"/>much leſſe the Church to be excommunicated, whereof ſuch an one is a member, and leaſt of all, before it did appeare, that the Church knew of it, or did tolerate it: The ſcope of my ſpeech was, not to hold forth the grievous deſert of a reproach, but the groundleſſe proceeding unto ſeparation for a reproach, both againſt a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and againſt the Church that tolerated him, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conviction, or obſtinacy, which was the caſe in hand of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams.</hi> Some body, he ſaith, reproached the Church of <hi>Salem</hi> for ſeparation, ſome member of ſome Church. But what member of what Church, he ſaith not? And yet this is one of the ſtumbling blocks that turned him out of the way of communion with all the Churches in the Countrey, who (for ought I know) never heard of it unto this day. Let him now ſay, that mine owne confeſſions are ſufficient Anſwers to my ſelfe, as if I granted, that in caſe the member had been knowne, who ſo reproached <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Church knowne whereof he was a member, <hi>That then there were a lawfull ſeparation from the Church that doth but tolerate her member in a cauſeleſſe reproach, yea and from all other Churches too, that hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with that Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he is not ignorant, more goeth to a ſeparation then ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he hath forgotten the principles and rudiments of Church-Government.</p>
               <p>He confeſſeth that to be true which I ſaid, <hi>That it is not Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but Butchery, to heale every ſore with no other medicine, but with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſion from the body:</hi> But yet as if he could make mine own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, confutations of my ſelfe, he ſaith that I have confeſſed (that which indeed is not my confeſſion, but my collection of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;) <hi>That Churches of godly perſons muſt be ſeparated from, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate worldlineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be a Contradiction, it is his, and not mine, as I ſhewed above; neither doe I own any ſuch confeſſion, as mine, which he ſubjoyneth; <hi>That Churches may be ſeparated from, when they tolerate their members in their cauſeleſſe reproaches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemeth, he thinketh, I neither remember mine own words, nor know any Church-Cenſure, but Excommunication.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth to tell us his judgement in ſo waighty a caſe as excommunication or ſeparation is: <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every ſore of infirmitie, or ignorance, but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer or Gangreene of obſtinacy, for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:160232:156"/>which I maintained, that a perſon ought to be cut off, or a Church ſepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rated from.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not how this judgement of his may ſatisfie his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but a good Conſcience willing to walke by rule, would ſtill inquire, (where it was meete) Firſt, whether every obſtinacy, even before conviction, and that in a ſinne leſſe hainous, be ſuch an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, or Gangrene, for which either a perſon ought to be cut off, or a Church ſeparated from? For there is an obſtinacy againſt a good way, as there is a ſcorning of a good way, which is before convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, even of ignorance: and to theſe Wiſdome communicateth good Counſell, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20.22. But there is a ſcorning, and ſo an obſtinacy, after conviction, and to ſuch, Wiſdome refuſeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any wholeſome words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8, 9.</p>
               <p>If he meane the former, why did he refuſe communion with us upon ſuch an obſtinacy of ignorance? By what rule did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede?</p>
               <p>If he meane the latter, let him produce his cauſe, and bring forth all his ſtrong reaſons, whereby he did ſo much as offer to convince us of our obſtinacy in any crime, and we will acknowledge his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to be juſt, and our ſinne to be great in not hearkening to him.</p>
               <p>If he tell us againe, (as he doth in the next words, as indeed the mouth is moſt full of the aboundance of the heart) if he tell us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of our guiltineſſe of cruelty, both againſt conſciences and bodies, in perſecuting of them, wee muſt needs tell him againe, that neither himſelfe, nor any others, (that I can heare off) did ever ſuffer any Cenſure, (which he calleth cruelty to conſciences and bodies) till after his ſeparation from all the Churches in the Countrey. And though he ſaith in the next words, <hi>He ſeparated Conſcientiouſly and peaceably:</hi> Yet did ever peaceable Conſcience (before him) ſeparate from Churches for an offence before it was committed?</p>
               <p>If he tell us, he ſeparated, for our communion with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>England,</hi> in hearing the word in the Pariſhes there, let all that feare God (whoſe hearts are not foreſtalled with prejudice or partiality) judge whether his reaſons alledged to convince us of ſuch a ſinne, (the ſtrongeſt whereof were anſwered in my Letter to him, and have been againe refuted in this Reply) have been of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:160232:156"/>ſuch convincing power, as that wee for not hearkening to him muſt needs lie under the guilt of an ulcer, or Gangrene of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and that after conviction. I may therefore well call it, not Chirurgery but Butchery, to cut off not onely ſo many members of Chriſt, but alſo ſo many Churches of Chriſt from fellowſhip with Chriſt, before any ulcer or Gangrene of obſtinacy was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us; Nay, I feare I might ſpeake a further word, (and yet I would be loath to ſpeake any doubtfull thing;) but ſurely (my memory much faileth me or elſe) he broke forth into this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, before he gave us any grounds of his ſeparation at all, or of our conviction of any ſuch ſinne, as might deſerve ſuch a Cenſure. And whether that be Butchery or Chirurgery, let the upright judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if it be Butchery to ſeparate conſcientiouſly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from the ſpirituall communion of a Church, or Saints, what ſhall it be called by the Lord Jeſus, to cut off perſons, them, and theirs, branch, and roote, from any Civill being in their Territories, &amp;c. Becauſe their Conſciences dare not how domne to any worſhip, but what the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath appointed, and being alſo otherwiſe ſubject to the Civill eſtate, and Lawes thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here be many extenuations, and mincings of his own carriage, and as many falſe aggravations of Guilt upon his ſentence of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the Authors of it.</p>
               <p>As, 1. In that he was cut off, he and his, branch and roote, from any Civill being in theſe Territories, becauſe their Conſciences durſt not bow downe to any worſhip, but what they beleeve the Lord had appointed: Whereas the truth is, his Baniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not againſt him, or his, for his own refuſall of any worſhip, but for ſeditious oppoſition againſt the Patent, and againſt the Oath of fidelitie offered to the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he was ſubject to the Civill eſtate, and Lawes thereof, when yet he vehemently oppoſed the Civill foundation of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill eſtate, which was the Patent: And earneſtly alſo oppoſed the Law of the generall Court, by which the tender of that Oath was enjoyned: and alſo wrote Letters of Admonition to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof the Magiſtrates were members, for deferring to give preſent Anſwer to a Petition of <hi>Salem,</hi> who had refuſed to hearken to a lawfull motion of theirs.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:160232:157"/>
               <p n="3">3. That he did but ſeparate from the ſpirituall ſociety of a Church, or Saints: whereas he both drew away many others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and as much as in him lay, ſeparated all the Churches from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In that he maketh the cutting off of perſons, them and theirs, branch and ruſh, from civill Territories, a farre more hainous and odious offence in the eyes of the Lord Jeſus, then himſelfe to cut off, not onely himſelfe and his, branch and ruſh, but many of his neighbours (by ſedition) from ſpirituall Communion with the Churches, and all the Churches from Communion with Chriſt. As if the cutting off perſons, them and theirs, branch and ruſh, from the Covenant, and ſpirituall Ordinances in the Church. were a matter of no account in reſpect of cutting off from Civill Liberties in the Territories of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In that, what himſelfe did, he predicateth as done conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly and peaceably, as if what the Court had done againſt him, they had not done conſcientiouſly alſo, and with regard to publick peace, which they ſaw he diſturbed, and ſtood ſtiffly in his own courſe, though he was openly convinced in open Court (as I ſhewed before) that he could not maintaine his way, but by ſinning againſt the light of his own Conſcience. As for his Marginall note, <hi>wherein he chargeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>to be deeply guilty of Cruelty, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſciences and bodies, in perſecuting of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will onely Anſwer thus much, (partly from <hi>David,</hi> partly from <hi>Job,</hi>) If the Lord have ſtirred him up thus to reproach me, (as <hi>Shimei</hi> did him) I hope the Lord will looke upon mine affliction, and requite me good for all his ſlander, this day, or this yeare, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16 12.

                  <hi>Salem</hi> had done before. My Speech was, <hi>That God had not proſpered the way of Separation: which leaſt it ſhould be miſtaken, I interpreted, not in reſpect of outward proſperitie: for they found more favour in our native Countrey, then thoſe who walked in the way of Reformation, which is commonly reproached by the name of</hi> Puritaniſme. <hi>The meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the</hi> Separatiſts <hi>might be knowne to the Officers in the Courts, and winked at, when the Conventicles of the</hi> Puritans <hi>(as they call them) are hunted out with all diligence, and purſued with more violence, then any Law can juſtifie. But I ſaid, that God had not proſpered the way of Separation, in that he had not bleſſed it, either with peace amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or with growth of grace, ſuch as erring through ſimplicitie, and tenderneſſe of Conſcience, have growne in grace, have growne alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their lawfull libertie, to returne to the hearing of the Word from Engliſh Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give Anſwer to this, the Examiner beſtoweth many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. His firſt Anſwer is, (that which is not unworthy to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, by all whom it concerneth,) <hi>That doubtleſſe the Lord hath a great Controverſie with the Land for their ſuch violent purſuit and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of both. For both of them have borne witneſſe to ſeverall truths of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Albeit, I deny not, the one party might have borne witneſſe to more points of Truth: the other might have borne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to fewer, and ſo have leſſe exceeded bounds of Truth. To make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches, and their Miniſteries, and their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and their Profeſſors, either nullities, or Antichriſtian, is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not onely beyond the truth, but againſt the Truth of the Lord Jeſus, and his word of Truth.</p>
               <p>But for their ſufferings; <hi>The Puritans</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have not ſuffered comparatively to the other, (as but ſeldome Congregating in ſeparate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies from the common:) And none of them ſuffering unto death for the way of Non-Conformitie. Indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the worthy witneſſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Udall <hi>was neere unto death for his witneſſe againſt Biſhops, and Ceremonies; But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Penry, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Barrow, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Greenwood <hi>followed the Lord Jeſus, with their Gibbets, and were hanged with him, and for him, in the way of ſeparation. Many more have been condemned in dye, baniſhed, and choaked in Priſans, whom I could produce upon occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply. Paul</hi> accounteth it a folly to make boaſts in compariſons, even of ſufferings: And therefore I chooſe to be ſparing and briefe in this Argument: wherein otherwiſe I could be copious, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:160232:158"/>another Volume of the Booke of Martyrs (as I heare) extant in the Countrey, (though not in print) of the ſufferings of the godly Miniſters and people, beginning where M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox</hi> left. When he ſaith, <hi>Their witneſſes againſt Biſhops and Ceremonies, (whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Puritans) have ſeldome met in ſeparate Aſſemblies from the common:</hi> It ſeemeth he never read the ſtory of the Claſſes in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Suffolk, Eſſex, London, Cambridge,</hi> diſcovered by a falſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> (Chaplain then to Lord Chancellor <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and after that Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>) nor that he ever tooke notice of Doctor <hi>Bancrofts</hi> Booke againſt them, entituled, <hi>Dangerous Poſitions and practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion and State;</hi> neither doth it ſeeme, that he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their frequent and continuall meetings to duties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, as any ſeparate meetings from the common. But I doubt not, the Lord tooke notice of both, and hath now rewarded their ſighes and groanes, prayers and teares in private with an open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and deliverance in the view of all men.</p>
               <p>Beſides, though he pleaſed to confine the witneſſe of theſe he calleth <hi>Puritans,</hi> unto Teſtimony againſt Biſhops and Ceremonies: yet I did not thinke, he had been ſuch a ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (if by his leave I may call it <hi>Iſrael</hi>) as to be ignorant, how farre both the Admonitions to the Parliament have reached to beare witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Biſhops and Ceremonies. To ſay nothing of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Deerings</hi> Sermon before the Queene, or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Chadertons</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe, or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Parkers Eccleſiaſtica Politica,</hi> or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baines</hi> his Dioceſans Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dall</hi> was neere it: Yet the truth is, he dyed by the annoyance of the Priſon, which he might as well have acknowledged as he doth of ſome of the Separatiſts in this very Paragraph, that they were choaked in Priſon. This I have underſtood by faithfull witneſſes, that when the Coroners Jury (according to the Law of <hi>England</hi>) came (as the manner is in ſuch caſes) to ſurvey the dead body of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dall</hi> in Priſon, he bled freſhly (though cold before) as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the murderous illegall proceedings of the State againſt him: for ſo the godly did apprehend it; judicious <hi>Perkins</hi> acknowledgeth ſuch a kinde of bleeding to be a part of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>That the bloud of</hi> Abel <hi>ſtill ſpeaketh.</hi>

               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:160232:158"/>
               <p>In like ſort, for the ſame cauſe (choaked in the priſon) ſuffered M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Randall Bates</hi> (an heavenly Saint) nor could he be releaſed, though Doctor <hi>Hering</hi> (a learned and beloved Phyſician) earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicited Biſhop <hi>Neale</hi> for his enlargement as he tendred his life, but the ſuite of the Phyſician was repulſed with reproaches: And the life of his patient ſpilt by that rigor. He is therefore much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, when he ſaith, <hi>None of them ſuffered unto death.</hi> And it is alike miſtake, when he maketh M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penry</hi> one of his witneſſes unto the death for Separation. I have received it from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hilderſom</hi> (a man of a thouſand) that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penry</hi> did ingenuouſly acknowledge before his death, That though he had not deſerved death for any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon the Queene, by that Booke (which was found in his ſtudy, and intended by himſelfe to be preſented to her own hand:) nor by the compiling of <hi>Martin Marprelate,</hi> (of both which he was falſly charged;) yet he confeſſed, he <hi>deſerved death at the Queenes hand, for that he had ſeduced many of her loyall Subjects to a ſeparation from hearing the Word of life in the Pariſh Churches. Which though himſelfe had learned to diſcerne the evill thereof, yet he could never prevaile to recover divers of her Subjects, whom he had ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and therefore the bloud of their ſoules, was now juſtly required at his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Examiner conſider, whether he will own this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penry</hi> for one of his faithfull witneſſes hereafter; If he doe, let him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe as he did, ſeeke to reduce thoſe ſoules whom he hath ſeduced from hearing the word of life: or elſe, let him confeſſe (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penry</hi> did) the bloud of thoſe ſoules may juſtly be required at his hands, if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penries</hi> witneſſe be of waight with him.</p>
               <p>Touching his other witneſſe, to the death of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barrow,</hi> this I can ſay, from the teſtimony of holy and bleſſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dod,</hi> who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barrow, God is not wont</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make choice of men, infamous for groſſe vices before their calling, to make them any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inſtruments of Reformation after their Calling. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Barrow <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he lived in Court, was wont to be a great Gamſter, and Dicer, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten getting much by play, would boaſt,</hi> Vivo de die, in ſpem noctis, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſhamed to boaſt of his hopes of his nights lodgings in the boſomes of his Courtizens.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:160232:159"/>me: And ſo being ſtopt by the hand of God, he was not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſpeake any thing to purpoſe more, either to the glory of God, or to the edification of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Greenwood</hi> (the Examiners laſt witneſſe unto death) he indeed of all the reſt was the more to be lamented, as being of a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and conſcientious ſpirit: but this have I heard reported of him by the ſame credible hands, That if he could have been ſundred from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barrow,</hi> he was tractable to have been gained to the truth. But when the Examiner goeth on to make compariſons between the Sufferings of the Separatiſts, and of (thoſe he ſtyleth) Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, in his Margent, and in his Booke. No compariſon will hold from the Separatiſts to them, but <hi>a Minori.</hi> What compulſory ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments have been put upon thoſe bleſſed and glorious lights, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cartwright, Parker, Ames?</hi> To ſay nothing of thoſe in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>New-England:</hi> When have the Priſons been vacant of ſome or other godly Miniſters, and Profeſſors?

And proviſion made, that none might practiſe Phyficke, or teach Schoole, unleſſe they would accept a Licence with ſubſcription? So that of neceſſicie (had not the Lord been wiſer, and ſtronger then men) they muſt in reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe miſery, they and theirs, have either begged, or ſtarved; But that with the Lord there be bowells of mercy, and fatherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, and with him are plenteous redemptions, and proviſions, and protections, when men faile.</p>
               <p>The Examiner proceedeth (in his Anſwer) to tell us further, <hi>That he beleeveth there hath hardly ever been a Conſcientious Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, who was not firſt a Puritan. For (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Can <hi>hath unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proved) the grounds and principles of the Puritans againſt Biſhops, and Ceremonies, and prophaneſſe of people profeſſing Chriſt: and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of Chriſts flock and diſcipline, muſt neceſſarily (if truly followed) lead on to, and enforce a ſeparation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. If there were hardly ever any conſcientious Separatiſt, who was not firſt a Puritan, then it ſeemeth, that if there be any Conſcience in the Separatiſts, it was firſt wrought in them by the Miniſters of thoſe whom he calleth Puritans.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:160232:159"/>
               <p n="2">2. Say it were true, that he pretendeth, That the principles and grounds of Puritaniſme, did enforce Separation:) yet I doe not underſtand, what it maketh to the point in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

And to prove all this out of the Principles and grounds of thoſe holy Saints of God, whom he miſnameth Puritans, will require a ſtrong efficacy of deluſions, to make it appeare probable to a ſad and judicious ſpirit, that is not ſoreſtalled with prejudice, or partialitie.</p>
               <p>But the Examiner proceedeth in his Anſwer to enquire, <hi>What ſhould be the Reaſon, why the Separatiſt (who witneſſeth againſt the Roote of the Conſtitution it ſelfe) ſhould finde more favour then the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, or Non-conformiſt?</hi>

               <p>The ſecond reaſon that he giveth is, <hi>That it is a principle in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to preferre a profeſſed enemy, before a pretended friend. The Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:160232:160"/>have been looked at by the Biſhops, and their adherents, as knowne and profeſſed enemies: whereas the Puritans have profeſſed ſubjection, and ſubmitted to the Biſhops, their Courts, their Officers, their Common Prayer, and worſhips: And yet (the Biſhops have well knowne) with no greater affection, then the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>bore the</hi> Aegyptians <hi>cruell task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. What the Non-conformiſts did beare, it was no more then they thought they might beare with a good Conſcience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light they had received. If they did beare more, then what in Conſcience they judged lawfull to be borne, they had no reaſon to beare with themſelves in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But if the Biſhops bore the leſſe with them in ſuch their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it was becauſe they looked at them not as pretended friends, but as more dangerous enemies: as knowing both that the Lord was with them, (which made <hi>Saul</hi> the more afraid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.28, 29.) as alſo that the grounds which they gave of their judgement and practiſe, were more agreeable to Scripture, and to the judgement of all reformed Churches, and therefore more likely in time to prevaile, to the utter overthrow of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Hierarchy. But as for the Separatiſts, the Biſhops did not diſcerne, either the Lord going forth in like ſort with them, or their grounds ſo likely to ſubvert their freehold. Though the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts ſtruck at the roote of the Conſtitutions of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (which was indeed a greater blow then to ſtrike at the roote of Epiſcopacy:) yet becauſe the Epiſcopacy ſaw that the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts ſtruck at the things of Chriſt, together with themſelves, they knew ſuch ſtroakes would not much hurt their ſtanding.</p>
               <p>The next word which the Examiner anſwereth, is unto that I ſaid; <hi>God hath not proſpered the way of Separation, neither with peace amongst themſelves, nor with growth of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His anſwer is; 1. <hi>That want of peace may befall the trueſt Churches of the Lord Jeſus, as them at</hi> Antioch, Corinth, Galatia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The diſtraction at <hi>Antioch</hi> was ſoone healed by the Counſell of the Synod at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which is a way of peace which the Churches of the rigid Separation have not knowne, nor will condeſcend unto: which makes their diſſentions deſtitute of hopes of reconciliation without ſeparation one from another. The like may be ſaid of the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth.</hi> I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:160232:160"/>doe not read their differences were healed by Separation, but by liſtning to Apoſtolicall Counſell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond Anſwer is, <hi>that it is a common Character of a falſe Church (maintained by the Smiths and Cutlers ſhop) to enjoy peace, none daring for feare of civill puniſhment to queſtion, or differ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Though it be a common Character of a falſe Church, to enjoy a forced and violent peace: yet it is a peculiar Character of a true Church, to enjoy holy peace with God, and one with another, which where it is wanting, there is ſomething elſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, either in their Faith or Order.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Anſwer is, <hi>That Gods people in that way have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times long enjoyed ſweet peace, and ſoule contentment, in</hi> England, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, New-England, <hi>and other places, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Anſwer had been more cleare and evident, if he had named thoſe Churches, who have long enjoyed ſuch peace in that way: in that way I ſay, of rigid Separation, ſeparating from the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> as altogether falſe, in their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Miniſtry, worſhip, and therefore refuſing to heare the word in the beſt of the Pariſh Aſſemblies. It is a wiſe Proverb of a wiſer then <hi>Soloman, The back ſlider in heart</hi> (from any Truth or way of God) <hi>ſhall be filled with his owne wayes.</hi> They that ſeparate from their brethren further then they have juſt cauſe, ſhall at length find cauſe (or at leaſt thinke they have found cauſe) juſt enough to ſeparate one from another. I never yet heard of any inſtance to the contrary, either in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Holland.</hi> And for <hi>New-England,</hi> there is no ſuch Church of the Separation at al that I know of. That ſeparate Church (if it may be called a Church) which ſeparated with Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> firſt broke into a diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a ſmall occaſion (as I have heard) and then broke forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> and then into <hi>Antibaptiſme,</hi> and <hi>Familiſme,</hi> and now finally into no Church at all.</p>
               <p>But whereas I ſaid, God had not proſpered the way <hi>of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as not with peace amongſt themſelves, ſo neither with growth of Grace,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He anſwereth, for growth of Grace, though ſome falſe <hi>brethren have crept in, yet Satan himſelfe cannot but confeſſe that multitudes of Gods witneſſes (reproached with the names of</hi> Browniſts, <hi>and</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts) <hi>have kept themſelves from the errours of the wicked, and doe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:160232:161"/>grow in Grace, and knowledge of our Lord Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is an unwelcome Subject to goe about to convince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of want of growth in Grace, eſpecially, when wee ſpeake of Churches, and that before wee have in a more private manner dealt with them. I looke at it as more ſeaſonable to provoke our owne Churches to more growth of Grace at home. For even true Churches (as that of <hi>Epheſus, Revel.</hi> 2.) may decay in their firſt love.</p>
               <p>Onely thus much I would ſay, the firſt Inventor of that way which is called <hi>Browniſme,</hi> from whom the Sect tooke its name, it is well knowne that he did not grow in Grace, but fell back firſt from his owne way, to take a Parſonage of a Pariſh-Church in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſheire,</hi> called a Church: God ſo in a ſtrange (yet wiſe) providence ordering, that he who had utterly renounced all the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> as no Church ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accept of one Pariſh-Church amongſt them, and it called a Church, and from thence he fell to Organs, in the Temple of his owne Church (as I have been credibly informed) and from thence to diſcord with his beſt hearers, and bitter perſecution of them at the laſt. It is not Gods uſuall manner of dealing to leave any of the firſt publiſhers or reſtorers of any Truth of his to ſuch fearefull Apoſtacy from his Grace, though I Judge not his finall Eſtate.</p>
               <p>I will not rehearſe what I read in printed Books of the unkind, and ungracious, and unbrotherly dealings of ſome of note in that way, whilſt they maintained the rigor of it. That which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer himſelfe hath rehearſed in this very chapter, may ſuffice to ſhew what growth of Godlineſſe was found in that Church, the Officer whereof himſelfe ſtyleth a worthy Inſtrument of Gods prayſe: and ſurely he was a man that deſerved well of the Church, for ſundry of his Learned, and painfull, and profitable labours. One would hope, that where the Lord bleſſeth a people with growth of godlineſſe, the people would grow beſt under the beſt Miniſters of that way. Mr. <hi>Aynſworths</hi> name is of beſt eſteeme (without all exception) in that way, who refuſed Communion with hearing in <hi>England.</hi> And if his people ſuffered him to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nine pence a week, with roots boyled (as the Examiner told us) ſurely either the people were growne to a very extreme, low
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:160232:161"/>Eſtate, or elſe the growth of their godlineſſe was growen to a very low ebb.</p>

               <p>IN his 24. and 25. Chapters, the Examiner giveth Anſwer to that ſpeech in my Letter, <hi>That ſuch (of the Separation) as erring through ſimplicity and tenderneſſe, have growne in Grace, have growne alſo to diſcerne their lawfull Liberty for the hearing of the word from the Engliſh Preachers.</hi> This I ſpeake with reſpect to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and to his Church, who as he grew to many excellent gifts both of Grace and nature: ſo he grew to acknowledge, and in a Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and godly diſcourſe to approve and defend the lawfull Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hearing the word from the godly Preachers of the Pariſhes in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this 24. Chapter the Examiner anſwereth nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of my ſpeech. Onely he telleth of <hi>foure ſorts of Backſliders from ſundry Truthes of God, whom he hath obſerved to be left of God to ſad and exemplary ſpirituall Judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe he ſpeaketh of ſuch as have decayed in grace, and I ſpeake of ſuch as grow in grace, his inſtances come not neere the point in hand.

But a ſincere humble Chriſtian, though he may ſtart aſide for a ſeaſon, yet Chriſt is not wont to leave him ſo: but ſeeketh up every ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheep of his, and bringeth them to heare and know his voyce in the mouthes of his Shepheards.</p>

               <p>He tels us, <hi>he might here engage himſelfe in a controverſie with me, but that neither the Treatiſe will permit: nor is there need, ſince it hath pleaſed the Father of Lights to ſtirre up the ſpirit of a faithfull

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> is unknowne unto me, and his Booke alſo: which I have not had the Liberty to get, in theſe remote ends of the world. I ſhall willingly beſtow the reading of them if they come to my hands, and God give opportunity, eſpecially if I ſee the ſpirit of a faithfull witneſſe in them, which the Examiner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth. Onely I am apt to thinke, as young men grow in yeares, and gifts, they will alſo grow up to the mellow-mildneſſe, and ſoftneſſe and moderation of riper age as Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> in many things did.</p>
               <p>Now from the name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preachers (which I uſed in my ſpeech) the Examiner though he ſeeme to decline the engaging of himſelfe in a controverſie about hearing of them, yet he taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to enter into a threefold diſcourſe about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt in (this chapter) concerning this title,</hi> Engliſh <hi>Preachers. Secondly, concerning hearing them in chapter</hi> 26. Thirdly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their calling in chap. 27.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of his diſcourſe about the title of theſe Preachers, ſtandeth in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>acknowledgeth, the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel, to Paſtors, Teachers, Biſhops, Overſeers, Elders: and that their proper worke is, to feed and governe, a truly converted, holy, and godly people, gathered into a flock or Church-Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And not properly Preachers, to convert, beget, make Diſciples, which the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts properly were: ſo that according to Mr.</hi> Cottons <hi>confeſſions,</hi> Engliſh <hi>Preachers are not Paſtors, Teachers, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Elders, but Preachers of glad newes (Evangeliſts) men ſent to convert and gather Churches, (Apoſtles,) &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, yet the Examiner confeſſeth, that at the Paſtors <hi>fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his flock, and at the Prophets prophecying in the Church, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleiver coming in may be convinced, &amp;c. but this is accidentall, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Examiner acknowledgeth that it pleaſed God <hi>to worke perſonall Repentance in the hearts of thouſands in</hi> Germany, England, Low-Countries, France, Scotland, Ireland, &amp;c. <hi>Yea, and who knoweth but in</hi> Italy, Spaine, <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>alſo, &amp;c. but all this hath been under the notion of Miniſters feeding their flocks,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:160232:162"/>not of Preachers ſent to convert the unconverted, and unbeleiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Though I acknowledge the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel, to be Paſtors and Teachers: yet it is farre from me to thinke (howſoever the Examiner againſt my mind reporteth my mind otherwiſe) that they are not properly Preachers, to converts beget, or make Diſciples, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For firſt though the worke of ordinary Miniſters were not to convert, but to feed ſoules: yet their act of feeding is properly exerciſed by preaching the word. <hi>Timothy</hi> (as a Miniſter) is taught of <hi>Paul</hi> how to behave himſelfe in the houſe of God which is the Church of God, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>And this he gave him in charge (as one great part of his worke) to preach the word <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they were neither Evangeliſts, nor Apoſtles, ſurely (for then they could not have been ſo miſcarried) but the ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, (Paſtors, and Teachers of Churches) of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16.) Some preach Chriſt ſaith he, even of envie, and ſtrife, and ſome of good will: The one preach Chriſt of contention not ſincerely: the other of Love.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. Speaketh he that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts onely, and not of ordinary Church-Officers? of all doubtleſſe, according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p>Moreover, what are Preachers but publiſhers of the Goſpel, or glad tydings of the word of God? for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>preach the word,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. And what is preaching the word, but explication and application of it? and is not the explication and application of the word, as fit to feed ſoules, as to convert them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, when he makes it to be not the proper worke <hi>of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Teachers, to preach for converſion, but accidentall onely, and counteth and calleth it a moſt prepoſterous worke for ordinary Miniſters to preach for converſion, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He muſt needs give me leave to diſſent from him, my Reaſons be 1. from the inſtitution and worke of the Miniſtery to the worlds end, whereof one is, to make Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
               <p>Say not, that is a peculiar Act of the Apoſtolick Office: for the Lord Jeſus ſpeaketh of three Acts: making Diſciples, Baptizing,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:160232:163"/>Teaching: and in the exerciſe of theſe he promiſeth to be with his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours unto the end of the world, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Succeſſours I ſay, for the Apoſtles themſelves were not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue themſelves in the exerciſe of thoſe Acts to the end of the world, in their owne perſons, but in their ſucceſſors, the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the end why Chriſt gave Paſtors, and Teachers, as well as Apoſtles and Evangeliſts: which was for the worke of the Miniſtery, for the gathering together of the Saints, as well as for the building of them up to a perfect man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly from the Eſtate of the Church, wherein it ſeldome or never falleth out, but ſome Hypocrites are found: and beſides them, many Infants, and theſe had need of converting Grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from the ordinary way of Converſion, which is by hearing the word, and the word preached by a Miniſter ſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. to 17. either therefore there muſt be no converſion of ſoules after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts: or thoſe who are to be converted, muſt be converted by private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or by the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel, the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Apoſtles; but ſurely not the firſt: for God will have in every age ſome or other converted to his Grace to praiſe his name throughout all Generations.</p>
               <p>Not the ſecond: for they ſhall not be ordinarily converted by private Chriſtians, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by a Preacher, and him ſent.</hi> Therefore the third way remaineth, that Faith is intended of God to be wrought from age to age by the ordinary Miniſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>If the Converſion of ſoules were accidentall to the worke of the Miniſter, it were then <hi>praeter ſcopum efficientis,</hi> beſides the intent of the worker. But it is neither beſide the intention of the principall worker, God (<hi>for he worketh all things according to the Counſell of his owne will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.) nor beſides the intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for as hath been ſaid, it is one maine intent and end of his Office, to make Diſciples, and gather Saints; and <hi>Solomon</hi> maketh it an act of wiſdome, and therefore not an act of accidentall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty to winne ſoules, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid why are they called Paſtors, if they be alſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Paſtors are for feeding: not for begetting.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:160232:163"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Paſtors are alſo Fathers: and though they be called Paſtors, yet the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel have other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles alſo, which imply more then feeding: as they are called Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Teachers of the ignorant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. (to miniſter ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge to them) as well as of men of underſtanding. And Elders in the greek Language have their name from Embaſſadors, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an Elder, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an Embaſſador, and it is one worke of heavenly Embaſſadors to beſeech men to be reconciled unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. yea and Paſtors themſelves (whoſe worke is properly to feed) their feeding is with the word of Life, which is able to quicken dead ſoules to life, as to nouriſh living ſoules to growth in Chriſt Jeſus. The whole worke of <hi>Peters</hi> Apoſtolicall calling was wrapped up in a Paſtorall name, and worke, <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two Reaſons therefore are voyd of true and ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which moved the Examiner to enter upon this <hi>paſſage. Firſt, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo many excellent and worthy perſons mainly preach for Converſion, and yet account themſelves fixed and conſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to particular Congregations, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that in theſe great Earth-quakes of all Eſtates civill and ſpirituall, ſuch a Miniſtry might be ſought after, whoſe proper worke might be preaching for converting of ſoules to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by that which hath been ſaid may plainely appeare that thoſe conſtant Miniſters who mainly preach for Converſion (ſo be it they attend, not to that onely, but to building up alſo) they doe herein attend to a proper worke of their calling: and now to looke for another new Miniſtry (ſay of Apoſtles or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts) to attend converſion of ſoules onely, is to looke for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which the Lord hath not promiſed: and beſides himſelfe hath ordained ſufficient ordinary meanes for that end, as hath been ſhewed both here, and in ſome former paſſages of this Treatiſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. The diſpenſing of the word in a Church-State (that is by Church-Officers to Church-members, united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church-State) it is indeed an expreſſion of familiar and deare Communion between Chriſt and his Church, as between the husband and his ſpouſe, between the nurſing mother and the child, and between the ſhepheard and his flock: But ſuppoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Indians ſhould ordinarily frequent our Church Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies (as they are wont to doe in hearing the word) doth he think, I would maintaine, that there is the like ſpirituall and familiar Communion between Chriſt, and them, as between Chriſt, and his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 2. Beſides, the queſtion is not what communion Chriſt may have with a ſtranger in the hearing of the word in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of his Church: but what communion there is between the Officer of the Church, who preacheth the word and the ſtranger. Chriſt out of his ſoveraigne grace may diſpenſe himſelfe to the ſtranger in what relation he pleaſeth; hee may make the word both as ſpirituall ſeed, and as food to him, and ſo may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf both a father, and a Paſtor, and husband, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him; and yet no ſuch Church-relation paſſe between the Church-Officer, and the ſtranger.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap>ſwer.</hi> 3. Suppoſe there did grow ſome ſpirituall relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church-Officer, and the ſtranger, (as God might ſo bleſſe his Miniſtery, as to make him a ſpirituall Father, and feeder to the ſtranger:) yet this Relation is not between the Preacher and the ſtranger in reſpect of his Office, but in reſpect of his gif, as I declared above.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:160232:164"/>
               <p>The reaſon of the difference is evident:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Church-relation, between a Church-Officer, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, is conſtant, and permanent, and not to be diſſolved, but by conſent of the Church: but this relation between the Preacher and ſtranger is tranſient, and the intercourſe of the exerciſe of their relation eaſily changeable, at the diſcretion of the ſtranger, without the conſent, or cognizance of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Church relation between an Officer and a member, carrieth on the duties of Church-worke between them unto full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. If any offence grow between an Officer, and a member, the one hath power to deale with the other in a Church-way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect healing: but there is not the like power or liberty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in preacher, or ſtranger, ſo to proceed one with another, in caſe of any ſuch offence.</p>
               <p>The Examiners ſecond Argument is taken alſo from mine own confeſſion, as if there were no waighty Argument to be found in this caſe, but what might be gathered up from the weakneſſe, or unwarineſſe of my expreſſions. But thankes be to God, that hath ſo guided my words, that no ſuch advantage can juſtly be taken from them, as to countenance ſo ungodly an error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton (ſaith he) <hi>confeſſeth, that the fellowſhip in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> (Phil. 1.5.) <hi>is a fellowſhip or Communion in the Apoſtles doctrine, Community, breaking of bread, and prayer, in which the firſt Church continued,</hi> Acts 2.46. <hi>All which overthroweth the doctrine of lawfull participation of the word and prayer in a Church-ſtate, where it is not lawfull to communicate, in the breaking of bread, or ſeales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be all the Concluſion that he ſtriveth for, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the word and prayer, is not lawfull in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate, where it is not lawfull to communicate in the ſeales, I ſhall never contend with him about it. I ſhould never thinke it lawfull there to enter into a Church-eſtate, where I thought it lawfull onely to partake in hearing, and prayer, and not in the ſeales alſo. But this is that I deny, A man to participate in a Church-eſtate, where he partaketh onely in hearing and prayer, before and after Sermon; and joyneth not with them, neither in their Covenant, nor in the ſeales of the Covenant.</p>

               <p>THe third part of the Examiners diſcourſe touching <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preachers, taketh up this 27. Chapter: and it is concerning the calling and commiſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preachers.</p>

                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>himſelfe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and others moſt eminent in</hi> New-England, <hi>have freely confeſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That notwithſtanding their profeſſion of Miniſtery in</hi> Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: <hi>yet in</hi> New-England <hi>(till they received a Calling from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church) that they were but private Chriſtians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As firſt, a Calling and Commiſſion from the Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>From a Pariſh of naturall and unregenerate perſons.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>

                  <hi>All which premiſes duly conſidered, he deſireth that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton, <hi>and all that feare God, might try what will abide the fiery Triall in this particular, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed in flaming fire, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> It is a weake cauſe that is maintained onely by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of adverſaries, and them either miſtaken or falſified.</p>
               <p>It is in him either a miſtake, or a fraudulent expreſſion of our mindes, to ſay, <hi>That notwithſtanding our former profeſſion of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in</hi> Old England, <hi>yet (till we received a Calling from a particular Church) we were but private Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech may be ſo conceived, as if notwithſtanding our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeſſion of Miniſtery in <hi>Old England:</hi> yet indeed we confeſt, our Miniſtery there was no Miniſtery: and this is a falſe expreſſion of our mindes.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo conceived, that we confeſt, we had no calling from a particular Church, till we came to <hi>New-England.</hi> And this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a falſe expreſſion of our mindes likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Or it may be conceived, that notwithſtanding our former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:160232:165"/>and exerciſe of Miniſtery in <hi>Old England:</hi> yet being caſt out from thence by the uſurping power of the Prelacy, and diſmiſſed (though againſt their wills) by our Congregations, (ſave onely ſuch as came along with us) we looked at our ſelves as private members, and not Officers to any Church here, untill one or other Church might call us unto Office. This ſence of our profeſſion is true, but nothing availeable to the Examiners intendment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is in him another miſtake, or elſe a fraudulent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our mindes, when he ſaith, <hi>Wee hold and freely confeſſe, that Chriſt Jeſus hath appointed no other Calling to the Miniſtery, but ſuch as we practiſe in</hi> New-England: <hi>And that any other Calling to the Miniſtery, which is not from a particular Congregation of godly perſons, is none of Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though we doe beleeve and profeſſe the calling which we have received to the Miniſtery in <hi>New-England,</hi> to be of Chriſt: yet</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an inſolent phraſe that ſavoureth of more arrogancy, then either we dare uſe, or allow in our ſelves or others, to ſeeme to make our calling to the Miniſtery in <hi>New-England,</hi> a Rule, and patterne, and precedent to all the Churches of Chriſt throughout the world. Did ever any man meete with ſuch an expreſſion in any of our writings? <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus hath appointed no other Calling to the Miniſtery, but ſuch as we practiſe in</hi> New-England? Such language doth neither become the lips of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams,</hi> nor of any Miniſter in <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though we beleeve our calling to be of God, yet we doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeve nor profeſſe, that every difference from us which other Churches may uſe in the calling of their Miniſters, doth ſtraight way make their callings no callings, or no callings of Chriſt. Though it be our manner (and as wee beleeve according to the word) that every Church chooſeth and calleth their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ordaineth them by the Presbytery of the ſame Church: yet if the Presbytery of other Churches commend a Miniſter to a vacant Church, and upon the acceptance of the Church, if the presbyters of thoſe Churches doe ordaine him with the conſent of the Church, we doe not profeſſe that this is no calling of Chriſt, or that theſe are no Miniſters of Chriſt. The f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee choice of the Church is preſerved (for ought we know) in their free acceptance of a Miniſter commended to them. And whether the Miniſter be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:160232:166"/>ordained by impoſition of hands, at all, or no, and if by impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, by the hands of fellow-Elders of other Churches with the conſent of the Church: We neither put ſo much waight in ſuch a Rite, though Apoſtolicall; nor doe we ſo farre reſtraine the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of communion of Churches, that if they ſhall communicate ſuch entercourſe of Church-actions one to another, then all their callings and adminiſtrations to be of none effect. Wee are not ſo maſterly and peremptory in our apprehenſions: And yet (with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) we conceive, the more plainly and exactly all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions are carried on according to the letter of the rule, the more glory wee ſhall give unto the Lord Jeſus, and procure the more peace to our Conſciences, and to our Churches, and reſerve more purity and power to all our Adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though we doe beleeve, and profeſſe, that a Church (by rule) ought to be a Congregation of godly perſons, or at leaſt of ſuch as profeſſe godlineſſe: yet if (through neglect of the power of doctrine) few godly perſons be left in a Congregation, &amp; (through neglect of diſcipline) few of thoſe who profeſſe godlineſſe be found ſo blameleſſe, as the purity of the Sanctuary requireth: yet we doe not ſtraight way profeſſe that ſuch Congregations are no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or that a Miniſtery choſen by ſuch a Congregation, are none of Chriſts.</p>
               <p>It is true, Gods chiefeſt regard is of his choſen Saints, godly perſons. To them, and for them, he hath given Church-eſtate, Church-Covenant, and ſeales, Church-Officers, with all the power of the adminiſtrations of the holy things, the ordinances of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. But yet that his holy Saints might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without ſcruples and diſtracting perplexities in their Church-Communion, the Lord is pleaſed for their ſakes to tolerate much hypocriſie, and many aberrations in Church-matters, before he reject Churches as no Churches, Miniſtery as no Miniſtery of Chriſt, callings as no callings.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake then a word to the inferences, which the Examiner gathereth from the two former miſtaken confeſſions of ours.</p>
               <p>As, 1. <hi>That a Calling or Commiſſion received from the Biſhops is none of Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. We doe not beleeve nor profeſſe, that the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> who received Ordination from the Biſhops, did receive
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:160232:166"/>their calling from the Biſhops; their Epiſcopall ordination is no part of their vocation to the Miniſtery. Their vocation or calling is from Chriſt by the Election or at leaſt acceptation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: The ordination is onely <hi>Adjunctum Conſummans</hi> of the ſolemnity of their calling, as hath been ſhewed above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Epiſcopall ordination, though it be an aberration from the inſtitution: yet we doe not conceive, that it maketh an abrogation of the calling of a Miniſter. Extrinſecall pollutions, though they defile the calling, yet they doe not deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>His ſecond inference is; <hi>That a Calling from a Pariſh of naturall and unregenerate perſons, is none of Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It is an hard ſaying, to ſay that all of the Pariſh are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and unregenerate Perſons. Such as are ſwift to judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſlow to judge others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Suppoſe they were all naturall and unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet they profeſſing Chriſtianitie, and meeting together every Lords day, for the worſhip of the Lord Jeſus, and deſiring to have a Miniſter to inſtruct them therein, their calling is not a nullitie. I cannot ſay, that the worſhippers of God at <hi>Philippi,</hi> (whereof <hi>Lydia</hi> was one) (who met together for prayer every Sabbath day) were any of them better then unregenerate perſons, before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> came amongſt them. And yet if a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> come and call <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> to come and helpe them, they aſſuredly gather, that the Lord had called them to preach the Goſpel to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9, 10.</p>
               <p>His third infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce is; <hi>That a Calling from ſome few godly perſons, yet remaining in Church fellowſhip after the Pariſh way, is not of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Then it would follow, that a remnant of godly perſons is not ſufficient to conſtitute and denominate a Church, if the greater part be corrupt and uncleane. But the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was of another minde, and hath taught us by the Holy Ghoſt to judge otherwiſe: <hi>Except</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.9.) <hi>the Lord of Hoſts had left us a very ſmall Remnant, wee ſhould have been as Sodom, wee ſhould have been like unto Gomorrah;</hi> In his judgement, it is not a multitude of hypocrites and prophane perſons, that maketh a Church (where a remnant of godly perſons are found) to become as <hi>Sodom</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah:</hi> But it is a remnant, a very ſmall remnant, that preſerve the Church from becoming as <hi>Sodom,</hi> or <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:160232:167"/>
               <p>His fourth and laſt inference is; <hi>That eminent gifts and abilities, are but qualifications fitting and preparing for a Call, or Office, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> 1 Tim. 3. Tit. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> We readily acknowledge it: but yet if a few godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall call for the employment of theſe gifts to their ſpirituall edification: The men who are qualified with theſe gifts, are not onely fitted and prepared for a call, or office, but actually called unto office; at leaſt, to preach the word unto them, though not to adminiſter the Covenant, or ſeales of the Covenant, but onely to them and their ſeed, who yeeld profeſſed ſubjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt Jeſus. If any through ignorance or infirmitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further in their adminiſtrations, I doe beleeve the repentance of the Miniſters, (for ſinnes knowne and ſecret) and the faith of the godly party, is more able to ſanctifie the corrupt and uncleane ſort to their Communion; then the corruption of the uncleane ſort is able to corrupt the Miniſter, and Worſhip, and Church-eſtate of all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Of this particular I have conſidered, not in a confuſed generalitie (as he delivereth it) but in a diſtinct apprehenſion, thus; The world is taken in Scripture more wayes then one, and ſo is ſeparation: The world is taken ſometimes for the frame of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and all the hoſts of them, man and beaſt, &amp;c. as when God is ſaid to <hi>have made the world,</hi> Act. 17.24.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:160232:167"/>of this world; as when the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> not to conforme their Church-bodies according to the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of the Romane Monarchy, into Oecumenicall, Nationall, Provinciall, Dioceſan Bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Sometime for the wicked of the world; as when it is ſaid, <hi>The world loveth his own,</hi> Joh. 15.19. <hi>And the whole world lyeth in wickedneſſe,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.19. Sometimes likewiſe, for the corruption that is in the world, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>The luſts of the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16.</p>
               <p>In like manner, there be more wayes of Separation then one; As, firſt, there is a ſeparation in affection, <hi>Love not the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16. Jam. 4.4. Secondly, there is a ſeparation in habitation, which is part of the meaning of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. Thirdly, there is a ſeparation of Communion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. to 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Beſides, there be diverſities likewiſe of Communion: for there is a Civill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and there is a religious Communion. And of either ſort, there is a confederate Communion: And there is a Communion without confederacy: And of confederate Communion, there is a confederacy in matters of common civilitie; and there is a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy in matters of more intimate friendſhip, ſocietie, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie.</p>
               <p>To apply theſe different conſiderations of the world, and of Separations, according to the due and right apprehenſion thereof in the word of truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is lawfull to have civill peace, and loving correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with neighbours in the world, yea even with Idolaters, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, ſo as not onely to trade with them, but to feaſt with them, yea and to ſuccour them in their diſtreſſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.34.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is lawfull to make leagues of peace with all men in the world, (even with Idolaters and Infidels) to wit, for free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, for trade, and inoffenſive neighbourhood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.44. to 53. <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.17.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, From the world, as taken for the Civill Government of it, we are to ſeparate our Church-bodies, and the government thereof in frame and conſtitution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, From the world, as taken for the Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys thereof, which are fit to pollute us with their prevalent pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, we are to ſeparate in our habitations; which is part of the meaning of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, From the world, as taken for the corruptions and luſts thereof, their evill examples, corrupt worſhip, Idolatries, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vaine faſhions, and the worldly perſons addicted to theſe things, we are to ſeparate, both in affection, and in Communion, whether we ſpeake of religious Communion, or of Civill Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Communion in matters of intimate friendſhip, ſociety, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie. As we may not partake in Idolatrous feaſts, or worſhip, nor enter into marriage-Covenant with Idolaters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. to 17. Nor may we confederate with them in leagues of amitie, to have friends and enemies in common, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.4. nor to have partnerſhip in trade and commerce, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, There is yet another ſeparation whereby the Church and people of God, doe ſeparate from the ſcandalous offenders of their own body, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. This, though it be in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner aymed at here by the Examiner, yet is it by him moſt improperly and confuſedly called ſeparation from the world. The Apoſtle doth moſt expreſly contradiſtinguiſh theſe, the one from the other: <hi>I wrote unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in an Epiſtle, not to company with fornicators: yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with Idolaters, for then muſt yee needs goe out of the world. But if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolater, with ſuch an one, no not to eate,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.9, 10, 11. As who ſhould ſay, a fornicator or Idolatrous
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:160232:168"/>brother of the Church is one thing; a fornicator and Idolater of the world is another, from a fornicator or Idolatrous brother, you are to be ſeparate: from a fornicator or Idolater of the world, in ſome kinde you need not to ſeparate; In as much therefore as the Churches of <hi>England</hi> doe not ſeparate ſundry notorious ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons from their Church-Communion, though it be a leavening corruption: yet their ſinne is not want of Separation from the world, but want of purification of the Church. In the meane time, they are ſeparated from the world of Pagans, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, as the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> notwithſtanding their toleration of all ſorts of offenders, Idolaters, murderers, adulterers, they were yet ſeparated from Pagans by profeſſion of a different Religion, and the ordinances thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular which the Examiner ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> hath not duely conſidered, is, <hi>That all the grounds and principles leading to oppoſe Biſhops, Ceremonies, Common Prayer, proſtitution of the Ordinances of briſt to the ungodly, and the true practiſe of Chriſts own Ordinances, doe neceſſarily conclude a ſeparation of holy from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, penitent from impenitent, godly from ungodly. And that to frame any other building upon ſuch grounds and foundations, is no other then to raiſe the forme of a ſquare houſe upon the keele of a Ship, which will never prove a ſoule ſaving true Arke or Church of Chriſt Jeſus according to the patterne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I cannot acknowledge what he ſaith, <hi>that I have not due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, that all the grounds and principles leading to oppoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Ceremonies, &amp;c. doe neceſſarily conclude a ſeparation of holy from unholy, &amp;c.</hi> For I have conſidered, and well weighed (after my ſlender meaſure) that they doe indeed conclude a three-fold ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of holy from unholy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doctrinall, that the Miniſter of Chriſt, whileſt he liveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch diſſolute and ſcandalous perſons, he is to ſeparate them in the application of his doctrine, between the holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, between the precious and the vile: ſo as to make ſad the hearts of the wicked, whom God would have to be made ſad, and to ſtrengthen the heart and hands of the righteous, whom God would have to be comforted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A practicall ſeparation in a mans own perſon, that what a man findeth upon thoſe grounds and principles to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:160232:169"/>and ſinfull, he doe forbeare the ſame in his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and diſſwade others from the ſame by his doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An Eccleſiaſticall ſeparation, that when a man cannot continue in fellowſhip with ſuch a Church, but that he ſhall be compelled to the practiſe of ſome ſinne, or of neceſſitie to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the ſinnes of others, then (after all good means uſed, in vaine, to redreſſe thoſe evils) meekly to ſeparate and withdraw himſelfe from fellowſhip with them in Church-Communion, as one that cannot enjoy the good which is found amongſt them, without partaking in ſundry evils that cleave to them.</p>
               <p>Thus farre I have conſidered the grounds and Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, (of which the Examiner ſpeaketh) and doe finde that they doe neceſſarily conclude, a ſeparation of holy from unholy thus farre. But I confeſſe, I have not conſidered, nor can I finde out, by any further due conſideration, that the principles and grounds of Reformation doe neceſſarily conclude a ſeparation from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches, as falſe Churches, from their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, as a falſe Miniſtery, from their worſhip as a falſe worſhip, from all their profeſſors, as from no viſible Saints. Nor can I finde, that they doe either neceſſarily or probably conclude, a ſeparation from hearing the word preached by godly Miniſters in the Pariſh-Churches in <hi>England:</hi> Nor can I finde, that the building of our Churches in theſe ends of the world <hi>is the raiſing up of a ſquare houſe upon the keele of a Ship,</hi> unleſſe it be the Arke of <hi>Noah:</hi> for as the ſoules in the Arke were ſaved from water; ſo we finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and good evidence from the word, that the Lord bleſſeth our Church-Communion and adminiſtrations with ſoule-ſaving efficacy, through his grace in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third particular, which the Examiner ſaith, I have not duely conſidered, is, <hi>The multitudes of holy and faithfull men and women, who have witneſſed this truth from Queene</hi> Maries <hi>dayes, by writing, diſputing, and ſuffering, farre above what the Non-conformiſts have done, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> This particular hath been conſidered above in Anſwer to Chapter 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The fourth particular, which he deſireth might be better conſidered, <hi>Is our own practiſe, and profeſſion. Our practiſe, in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:160232:169"/>conſtituting our Churches of none but godly perſons, and uniting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a body by voluntary mutuall Covenant, and adding none to them, but perſons carefully examined and approved, and entering by way of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of their ſinnes, and of their faith. Our practiſe alſo, in ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other</hi> Engliſh, <hi>who have attempted to ſet up a Congregation in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhionall way. Our profeſſion in the late Anſwer we gave to many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons, (whom yet we account godly Miniſters and people) that we could not permit them to live in the ſame Common-wealth together with us, if they ſhould ſet up any other Church and Worſhip, then what our ſelves practiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Our practiſe in the conſtituting and ordering our own Churches here, holdeth forth, what matter, and forme, and order of the Church, we doe beleeve to be moſt agreeable to the patterne ſet before us in the Goſpel of Chriſt. And our not receiving all commers unto the Communion of the Lords Table, and other parts of Church-fellowſhip, (ſaving onely, unto the publick hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and preſence at other duties) it argueth indeed, that ſuch perſons, either thinke themſelves unfit materialls for Church-fellowſhip, (and ſo they never offer themſelves to us) or elſe that we our ſelves conceive them to be as ſtones ſtanding in need of a little more hewing and ſquaring, before they be layed, as living ſtones in the walls of the Lords houſe. All which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely to this, That we doe conſider and bewaile the defects of the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> in receiving ignorant and ſcandalous perſons to all the liberties of the Lords Table, and of his houſe, as other wayes. But it doth not at all argue (neither is it our minde it ſhould argue) their Churches, and worſhip, and Miniſtery, and members, ſhould all of them be ſeparated from as falſe, or none at all.</p>
               <p>Our practiſe in ſuppreſſing ſuch as have attempted to ſet up a Pariſhionall way, I never heard of ſuch a thing here to this day. And if any ſuch thing were done, before my coming into the Countrey, I do not thinke it was done by forcible compulſion, but by rationall conviction.</p>
               <p>But as for our profeſſion, that wee ſhould <hi>anſwer many worthy Miniſters and people in</hi> England, <hi>that wee could not permit them to live in the ſame Common-wealth with us, if they varied from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have cleared it above (in Anſwer to Chapt. 11.) to be a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:160232:170"/>falſhood: and but that I know the Devill is able to create ſlander of nothing, (as God is able to create truths of nothing) I ſhould thinke it incredible, that any man who hath been in <hi>New-England</hi> ſhould be able to ſay, (as the Examiner here doth) <hi>that we perſecute the Pariſhes in</hi> New-England, <hi>and yet frequent the Pariſhes in</hi> Old England.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The fift particular which he thinks I have not duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is, <hi>That in the Pariſhes (which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> Cotton <hi>holdeth but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men) how ever they would have liberty to frequent the worſhip of the Word, yet they ſeparate from the Sacraments: And yet (according to our own Principles) there is as true Communion in the miniſtration of the Word, as in the Seales. What myſtery</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould be in this, but that here, (to wit, in</hi> Old England) <hi>the Croſſe of Chriſt may be avoyded, if perſons come to Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It is an untruth, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> holdeth the Pariſhes to be but inventions of men; for though I hold, that the receiving of all the Inhabitants in the Pariſh, into the full fellowſhip of the Church, and the admitting of them all unto the liberty of all the Ordinances, is an humane corruption, (and ſo if he will, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention;) yet I doe not hold, nor ever did, that their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes were onely an humane invention. For I beleeve, the Lord Jeſus hath the truth of his Churches, and Miniſtery, and worſhip in them, notwithſtanding the inventions of men ſuperadded to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. Though I doe beleeve, there <hi>is as true Communion in the miniſtration of the Word in a Church-eſtate (to wit, to ſuch as are in Church-eſtate) with the Miniſter of the Word, as in the Seales.</hi> Yet it is farre from me to hold, and from any principle of mine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that there is as true Communion in the miniſtration of the Word to every hearer, as in the Seales; for then we might as eaſily admit our <hi>Indians</hi> to the Seales, as we doe admit them daily to the miniſtration of the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. It is a malignant and Satanicall miſconſtruction of the intentions of ſuch godly perſons, who (out of ſincere affection to ſpirituall growth) doe heare the Miniſtry of the Word from god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preachers in <hi>England,</hi> to accuſe them before God, and Angels, and men, that they doe it to avoyd the Croſſe of Chriſt, (to wit, perſecution) which may be avoyded in a great meaſure, if perſons come to Church.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:160232:170"/>
               <p>It is well knowne, that ſundry of them are ſo ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their profeſſion, that as they have ſuffered much for the cauſe of Chriſt, againſt humane corruptions in Gods worſhip: ſo they would be ready to ſuffer yet more, for neglecting to come to Church, if they ſuſpected any humane corruption at all in it.</p>
               <p>Againe, It is well knowne, that any ſtranger in <hi>London,</hi> (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving now and then his lodging) may eſcape not onely perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but obſervation, for a longer time, then any of our hearers are ordinarily wont to ſojourne there: Beſides, in this time of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall freedome from all perſecution during this long Parliament, why doe not our members of theſe Churches forbeare to heare the Word in the Pariſhes now, when there is no feare nor danger at all of perſecution, for not coming to Church?</p>
               <p>His ſixt and laſt particular conſideration is, <hi>That how ever M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Cotton <hi>ſaith, He hath not found ſuch preſence of Chriſt and evidence of the Spirit in ſuch (ſeparate) Churches, as in the Pariſhes: What ſhould be the reaſon of their great rejoycings and boaſtings of their own ſeparations in</hi> New-England, <hi>in ſo much, that ſome of the moſt eminent amongst them have affirmed, that even the Apoſtles Churches were not ſo pure? Surely if the ſame new</hi> Engliſh <hi>Churches were in</hi> Old England, <hi>they could not meete in</hi> Old England <hi>without perſecution: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in</hi> Old England <hi>they avoyde, by frequenting the way of Church-worſhip in the Pariſhes, which in</hi> New-England <hi>they perſecute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. The Examiner might eaſily have ſatisfied himſelfe in this conſideration, if he had been willing to underſtand that which he knoweth to be our meaning. He knoweth very well, and hath often told us of it before, that we our ſelves in our Churches doe practiſe ſome kinde of ſeparation here, to wit, ſeparation, not from the Churches in <hi>Old England,</hi> as no Churches, but from ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions found in them. In ſuch Churches as ſo ſeparate, wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeake of them, that we had not found the preſence of Chriſt, or evidence of the Spirit in ſuch Churches. But I ſpeake of ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Separatiſts Churches, as renounce the Churches, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and worſhip, and Saints of <hi>England,</hi> as if they were all falſe, or none at all, and therefore utterly doe refuſe to heare the word in their Aſſemblies, which is ſuch a way of ſeparation, as I told him in my Letter, <hi>the Lord Jeſus never delivered, nor any of his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, nor any of his Prophets before him.</hi> Of which he taketh no
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:160232:171"/>notice, nor giveth any ground either from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or Prophets, for ſuch practiſe; but putteth us off, that we practiſe ſeparation our ſelves, and rejoyce therein, as if our ſeparation and theirs were both of one nature, and meaſure: which indeed differ as much (as I ſaid before) as Chirurgery, and Butchery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 2. When he telleth us, <hi>We boaſt of our ſeparations in</hi> New-England, <hi>yea ſo farre, as that ſome of our moſt eminent have ſaid, that even the Apoſtles Churches were not ſo pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt needs profeſſe, I never heard, nor read of ſuch a ſpeech, but onely in this Examiners Booke. The ſpeech it ſelfe ſavoureth, I know not whether of more ignorance, or arrogancy, or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. The broadeſt ſpeech in this kinde, that ever I heard to fall from the lips of any in this Countrey, was that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelfe, who whileſt he lived at <hi>Salem</hi> (as I am credibly informed) would ſay, <hi>That of all the Churches of Chriſt in the world, the new</hi> Engliſh <hi>were the moſt pure, and of all the new</hi> Engliſh, <hi>the Church of</hi> Salem. I am ſo well acquainted with the liberty and boldneſſe of the Examiners tongue in calumniations, that untill I know the name of that eminent perſon, whom he reproacheth to have ſo ſpoken, he muſt give me leave to feare, either a miſtake, or that which is worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 3. It is a double calumny, (but ſuitable to many other of the former) <hi>that wee in</hi> New-England <hi>doe perſecute the way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, whether the one kinde of ſeparation, or the other.</hi> It is true of neither, for we practiſe the one, and tolerate the other.</p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>that we frequent the Pariſh-Churches in</hi> Old England, <hi>to avoyd perſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unleſſe mens tongues were their own, I wonder, how they can allow themſelves to ſpeake ſo exceſſively at random.</p>
               <p>Theſe his ſix Conſiderations, having ſo little conſiderable truth, or waight in them, I juſtly ſaid, <hi>That he in withdrawing the people of God from hearing the voyce of Chriſt in ſo many Congregations, both in</hi> New-England, <hi>and in Old, did not helpe Jehovah againſt the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Satan againſt Jehovah, and againſt the mighty Ordinances of his Word, and Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he anſwereth, that <hi>he helpeth the zealous ſoules of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>How he helpeth them I know not, unleſſe it be by depriving
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:160232:171"/>them of many precious meanes of grace, which they might enjoy by hearing the Word in either <hi>England:</hi> or unleſſe by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he now helpe them, <hi>Proficere in peius,</hi> to ſeparate further from all inſtituted worſhip of the Lord, to caſt off their own Churches, Miniſtery, Worſhip, as they have caſt off others before, that ſo they might ſeeke (for that which will never be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne) new Apoſtles to make all things new. And as little doe I know, how he helpeth us to ſeeke the Lord Jeſus without halting, unleſſe it be to ſeeke him, as he himſelfe doth without Church-Ordinances.</p>
               <p>For the Concluſion of his Booke, he is willing to take up the concluſion of my Letter; <hi>That whoſoever will not kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> (that is, will not heare and embrace the words of his mouth) <hi>ſhall periſh in their way,</hi> Pſal. 2.12.</p>
               <p>This word is eſtabliſhed in heaven, and will take place in the earth throughout all generations.</p>
               <p>But leaſt this word might profit himſelfe, (as ſelfe-love is apt to apply a word of threatening to any rather then to it ſelfe) he applieth it to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and <hi>to every ſoule,</hi> (to whom theſe lines of his may come) <hi>ſeriouſly to conſider, in this Controverſie, if the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus were himſelfe in perſon in Old, or</hi> New-England, <hi>what Church, what Miniſtery, what Worſhip, what Government he would ſet up, and what perſecution he would practiſe toward them that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Anſwer, let me ſay in a word, this point hath been ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered already: and let it be ſtill conſidered and pondered in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and doubtleſſe, for the firſt of theſe points, it will be found, that if the Lord Jeſus were here himſelfe in perſon, he would ſet up no other Church, nor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, nor worſhip, nor government, then what himſelfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Word: which though the Examiner, and many others, have ſought and ſearched what enormities they might finde in it, yet they have wearied themſelves, and found nothing. So true is the faithfull promiſe of the Lord Jeſus, that he hath built his Church upon a Rock, and the gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt it, nor againſt the Ordinances thereof.</p>
               <p>And for the latter point; <hi>What perſecution the Lord Jeſus if he were on earth, would practiſe againſt thoſe who would not receive him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Anſwer is neere at hand, and is written for the warning of all gain-ſayers; <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reigne over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before my face, Luk.</hi> 19.27. And yet I would not be ſo underſtood (in alledging this Scripture) as if Chriſt did allow his Vicegerents to practiſe all, that himſelfe would practiſe in his own perſon. For not all the practiſes, or acts of Chriſt, (as the Examiner ſeemeth to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) but the Lawes of Chriſt, are the Rules of mans Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. But of that more diſtinctly in due time, if the Lord ſhall give libertie to enquire further into the Examiners <hi>Bloudy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>
